<h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface"></a>Preface</h2>


<p>The first edition of Deam's "Trees of Indiana" was published in
1911. By limiting the distribution, the edition of 10,000 lasted
about three years. The demand for a book of this kind was so great
that a second edition of 1,000 copies was published in March 1919.
This edition was exhausted within five days after its publication was
announced, and thousands of requests for it could not be filled. These
came from all classes of people, but the greatest demand was from
the school teachers of the State.</p>

<p>Since forestry is an integral part of agriculture which is now taught
in our public schools, and since a book on the trees of the State is in
demand, the Conservation Commission has authorized a revised
edition of "The Trees of Indiana." What was formerly Bulletin No.
3 of the Division of Forestry is now published as Publication No. 13
of the Department. The reader's attention is called to a new departure
in illustrations, which were made from photographic reproductions
of specimens in Mr. Deam's herbarium. The photographs
were taken by Mr. Harry F. Dietz of the Division of Entomology.
It is believed that it will be gratefully received by the public and will
stimulate an interest in forestry that should achieve practical results.</p>

<p class="caption1">Trees of Indiana</p>

<h2><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>The present edition has been entirely rewritten. While the general
plan of the first edition has been followed, some changes have been
made.</p>

<p>The number of trees included has been wholly arbitrary. All woody
plants of the State which generally attain a maximum diameter of
10 cm. (4 inches) at breast high are regarded as tree forms. <i>Alnus
rugosa</i> which so closely resembles <i>Alnus incana</i>, is an exception, and a
description of it is given to aid in the identification of our tree form of
<i>Alnus</i>. Also several species of Cratægus are included which commonly
do not attain tree size. The species of all Cratægus begin to flower
and fruit many years before they attain their maximum size. The
genus is much in need of study, and the smaller forms are included
to stimulate a study of the genus, and in order that the larger forms
may be more easily and certainly identified.</p>

<p>The number of introduced trees has been limited to those that more
or less freely escape at least in some parts of the State. The one exception
is <i>Catalpa bignonioides</i>, which is given to help separate it from
our native catalpa, both of which are now commonly planted.</p>

<p><b>Botanic Description.</b>&mdash;The botanic descriptions have been made
from specimens collected in Indiana. In most instances the material
has been quite ample, and collected from all parts of the State. Technical
terms have been avoided, and only when precision and accuracy
were necessary have a few been used which can be found in any school
dictionary. The length of the description varies in proportion to the
importance and interest of the species and the number of characters
necessary to separate it from other forms. The characters used are
those which are the most conspicuous, and are generally with the
specimen at hand. In most instances mature leaves are at hand, and
these are most fully described. When leaves are discussed, only mature
and normal leaves are considered. The descriptions are not drawn to
include the leaf forms, and sizes of coppice shoots or seedlings.
Measurements of simple leaves do not include the petiole unless
mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>When the term twig is used, it means the growth of the year. Branchlets
and branches mean all growth except the present year. By seasons
are meant the calendar seasons.</p>

<p>The size of trees is designated as small, medium and large. These
terms are defined as follows: Small trees are those that attain a diameter
of 2 dm.; medium-sized trees are those whose maximum diameter is
between 2 dm. and 6 dm.; large-sized trees are those which are commonly
more than 6 dm. in diameter. Diameter measurements are at
14 dm. (4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>) feet above the ground, or breast high.</p>

<p>The common names given are those most generally used in our area.
Where common names are rarely applied to our forms, the common
commercial or botanical common name is given. In some instances
where a tree is known by several names, one or more of which are often
applied to a related species, the liberty has been taken to select a
common name which should be restricted to the one species.</p>

<p>Botanical names are usually pronounced according to the English
method of pronouncing Latin. The accented syllables have been
marked as follows: the grave (\) accent to indicate the long English
sound of the vowel and the acute (/) accent to show the short or
otherwise modified sound.</p>

<p>Measurements have been given in the metric system, and in some
instances the English equivalent has also been given.</p>

<p>The nomenclature attempted is that of the International Code.
The sequence of families is that of Gray's Manual, 7th Edition.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;The general distribution of the species is first
given, which is followed by the distribution in Indiana. The general
distribution has been obtained by freely consulting all the local floras
and general works on botany. The Indiana distribution has been
obtained for the greater part from specimens represented in the writer's
herbarium and from notes in doing field work during the past 24 years.
Since the first edition of the "Trees of Indiana" was published the
writer has traveled over 27,000 miles in Indiana, via auto, making a
special study of the flora of the State, and has visited every county and
has traversed practically every township in the State. In discussing
numbers in distribution it was decided to use terms already in common
use, but to assign a definite meaning to each as follows: Very common
means more than 25 trees to the acre; common, 5-25 trees to the acre;
frequent 1-5 trees to the acre; infrequent, 1 tree to 2-10 acres; rare,
1 tree to every 11-100 acres; very rare, 1 tree to more than 100 acres;
local when the distribution is circumscribed or in spots.</p>

<p>Where a species has the limit of its range in our area, its distribution
is sometimes given at length for scientific reasons. It should be remembered
that some of the older records of distribution were made by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
geologists or inexperienced botanists, and when such records are questioned
it is done with a spirit of scientific accuracy. Some of our early
authors did not distinguish between cultivated and native trees, which
involves the distribution of certain species.</p>

<p>The habitat of many species is discussed; which suggests forestal,
horticultural and ornamental possibilities. Then too, the habitat of a
tree, helps to identify it. When associated trees are given, those are
enumerated which are characteristic of the species throughout its range
in our area and they are arranged in the order of their abundance.</p>

<p>A county map of the State is included which will assist in finding the
range of each species. A forestal area map is also added to visualize
certain habitats of the State.</p>

<p>The range and distribution of the species in the State has been given
considerable attention to encourage investigation along this line.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Under this title the economic uses of the trees and their
products have been given. In addition horticultural and unclassified
information is included.</p>

<p><b>Illustrations.</b>&mdash;All of the illustrations except two are photographic
reproductions of specimens in the writer's herbarium. The two drawings
were used in the first edition.</p>

<p>About 20 of the photographs were made by Paul Ulman, and the
remainder by Harry F. Dietz, who has laboriously tried to obtain good
reproductions from the material at hand.</p>

<p><b>Explanation of Map of Certain Forestal Areas.</b>&mdash;In describing
the distribution of certain species of trees within the State, it was found
convenient to speak of certain forestal areas which are here described,
and are illustrated by a map which may be found at the end of the text.</p>

<p><i>Lake Region</i>:&mdash;The southernmost lakes in Indiana are those located in
the southwestern part of Wells County; Lake Galacia about five miles
northeast of Fairmount in Grant County; Lake Cicott in Cass
County; and Kate's Pond about 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> miles northwest of Independence
in Warren County. Roughly estimated, all of Indiana north of a line
connecting these lakes might be considered the lake area of the State.
<i>Prairie Area</i>:&mdash;While the interior of Indiana has quite a few small
areas called prairies, the real western prairie did not extend far into the
State. The dividing line is very irregular, and several elongated lobes
extended farther east than indicated by the map. The larger areas
east of the line were the extensive prairie area of the Kankakee Valley;
the northern part of Pulaski County; and parts of White and Tippecanoe
Counties. <i>"Knob" Area</i>:&mdash;This is the hilliest part of the State
and is located in the southcentral part. It is contained in the unglaciated
portion of the State, and includes the "knobs" of the

this area are included the scrub pine and chestnut oak, with one exception;
sorrel tree and the chestnut, with two possible exceptions. <i>The
Flats</i>:&mdash;This is a level stretch of country, here and there deeply eroded.
Being level, and the soil a fine compact clay, the drainage is poor which
suggested the local name "flats." <i>The Lower Wabash Valley</i>:&mdash;This
is part of Knox, Gibson and Posey Counties which is usually inundated
each year by the Wabash River.</p>

<p><b>Acknowledgments.</b>&mdash;The character and qualities of the wood have
for the greater part been taken from the works of Britton and
Brown, Hough, and Sargent, to whom indebtedness is acknowledged.</p>

<p>The <i>Salicaceæ</i>, except the genus <i>Populus</i> was written by C. R. Ball,
of the Bureau of Plant Industry, Washington, D. C. The <i>Malaceæ</i>
was contributed by W. W. Eggleston, also of the Bureau of Plant Industry,
Washington, D. C. These authors were asked to make their
part conform to the general plan of the book. Mr. Ball and Mr.
Eggleston are recognized authorities on the respective parts they have
written and users of this book will appreciate the value of having these
difficult parts written by our best authorities. The author wishes to
gratefully acknowledge this great favor.</p>

<p>The most grateful acknowledgement is given to Prof. Stanley
Coulter, Dean, School Science, Purdue University, who has read all of
the manuscript and made valuable suggestions, corrections and criticisms.</p>

<p>I wish to acknowledge the assistance of Stella M. Deam, my wife, in
field and clerical work.</p>

<p>I wish to thank the Department of Conservation for the opportunity
of doing this work.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Newfoundland to Manitoba, south to Iowa, Kentucky
and along the Alleghany Mountains to northern Georgia. The
mass distribution of this species is to the north of our area, and in
Indiana it is local and found in small numbers. It is a common tree on
some of the dunes bordering Lake Michigan, and is found locally
throughout the area bordering Lake Michigan. Its distribution in this
part of the State has not been studied, but it is believed that in Lake
and Porter Counties it is not at present found far from the Lake.
Blatchley<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> reports "a thicket of this species about a peat bog on the
Hayward farm one mile east of Merrillville in Lake County." The
writer has seen it as a frequent tree in a black oak woods about four
miles southwest of Michigan City, also quite a number of large trees
seven miles northeast of Michigan City in a swampy woods, associated
with white elm, black ash, soft maple, etc.</p>

<p>Nieuwland<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> reports a single tree found in a tamarack swamp 25 miles
east of Michigan City near Lydick in St. Joseph County. The next
appearance of this species is to the south in Warren County on the outcrops
of sandstone along Big Pine, Little Pine, Rock and Kickapoo
Creeks. It is found more or less on bluffs of these creeks. It was the
most abundant along Big Pine Creek, and followed up the creek for
a distance of about ten miles, or midway between Rainsville and Indian
Village. To the south it is next found in Fountain County on the outcrops
of sandstone along Big Shawnee and Bear Creeks. Franklin
Watts who owns the "Bear Creek Canyon" just south of Fountain
says he remembers the area before any cutting was done along the
creek. He says that the white pine was a common tree along the creek
for a distance of half a mile and that a few scattered trees were found
as far as 40 rods from the creek. He stated that the largest trees were
about 30 inches in diameter and as high as the highest of the surrounding
trees. Moving southward it is next found on a ridge of sandstone in
Montgomery County on the south side of Sugar Creek about a mile east
of the shades. Here it is closely associated with hemlock which is
absent in all of the stations to the north. Coulter<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> reports a colony in
the "knobs" of the northeast corner of Floyd County. This species
was also reported from Clark County by Baird and Taylor. The writer
has made inquiry and diligently searched for this species in this county
but failed to locate it. In the vicinity of Borden where the Jersey pine
grows, millmen distinguish two kinds of pines. Investigation showed
that both are Jersey pine. The one with resinous exudations along
the trunk is one kind, and trunks without exudation is the other.
Since Baird and Taylor include cultivated trees in their list of the plants
of Clark County, it is proposed to drop this reference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;White pine on account of the excellent qualities of its
wood is in great demand, and has always ranked as one of our leading
timber trees. In fact it was so highly prized that practically all of the
original stand of this species has been cut.</p>

<p>The tree adapts itself to many habitats, hence has been used extensively
for forestry purposes both in America and Europe. In fact it was
the most used tree in forestry until about ten years ago when the white
pine blister rust was discovered in America. This disease is now found
in practically all of the states where this species forms dense stands.
However, Federal and State authorities are trying to stamp out the
disease. In Indiana it is a species well worth a trial for forestry purposes,
especially in windbreaks where other species are used.</p>

<span class="smcap">Gray Pine. Jack Pine.</span> <a href="#Plate_3">Plate 3.</a>
A small tree 10-15 m. high with reddish-brown bark, broken into
short flakes; shoots of season yellow-green, turning reddish-brown,
smooth; leaves dark green, in twos, 2-5 cm. long, divergent, curved or
twisted, rigid, sharp-pointed, persisting for two or three years; cones
sessile, sharp-pointed, oblique at the base, 3-5 cm. long, usually
pointing in the direction of the branch; wood light, soft and weak.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;The most northern of all of our pines. Nova Scotia
to northern New York, northern Illinois, Minnesota and northward. In
Indiana it is found only on and among the sand dunes in the immediate
vicinity of Lake Michigan, and in no instance has it been seen more
than three miles from the Lake. Found sparingly in Lake, Porter and
Laporte Counties. It is the most abundant in the vicinity of Dune

Bark dark-brown with rather shallow fissures, the ridges broken,
somewhat scaly; shoots green, light brown or purplish with a bloom,
becoming a gray-brown; leaves in bundles of two, rarely three, twisted,
usually about 4-5 cm. long, deciduous during the third or fourth year;
cones sessile or nearly so, narrowly conic when closed, 4-7 cm. long,
opening in the autumn of the second season; scales armed with a curved
spine 2-4 mm. long; wood light, soft, weak, brittle and slightly resinous.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Long Island to South Carolina, Alabama and north
to Indiana and Licking County, Ohio. The distribution in Indiana is
quite limited, and has never been understood by authors who variously
give it as found throughout the southern part of Indiana. It is confined
to the knob area of Floyd, Clark and Scott Counties, and the southeastern
part of Washington County. In the original forest it is confined
to the tops of the knobs where it is associated with Quercus
Prinus (Gray's Man. 7th Edition). It propagates easily from self-sown
seed, hence is soon found on the lower slopes of cut-over lands,
and soon occupies fallow fields. It is now found in the open woods
several miles east of the knobs in the preceding counties, but pioneers
of this section say it was not a constituent of the original forests but
has come in since the original forests were heavily cut over. It is
believed that it crowned the knobs over our area from 5-10 miles wide
extending through the counties named and extending northward about
25 miles. This species is found in the open woods on a few hills on
the Millport Ridge in the northern part of Washington County, and it
appears as if native, but investigation showed that it had spread from
a tree on the site of a pioneer's cabin. It is also found as a frequent
escape on the wooded bluff of Raccoon Creek in the southern part of
Owen County, and appears as native here. It is associated on the bluff
and slope with hemlock. Chas. Green, a man of sixty years, who owns
the place says the trees were seeded by a tree planted in his father's
yard nearby. His father also planted a white pine in his yard, and it is
to be noted while the Jersey Pine has freely escaped the white pine has
not, although the habitat seems favorable.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;In its native habitat on the exposed summits of the
"knobs" it is usually a small tree about 3 dm. in diameter and 10 m.
high. When it finds lodgement on the lower slopes and coves it may
attain a diameter of 7 dm. and a height of 25 m. This tree is really
entitled to be called "old field pine" on account of its ability to establish
itself on them.</p>

<p>From the ease with which this species propagates itself from seed it
seems worthy a trial for forestry purposes in the "knob" area of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
State. However, all attempts to grow this species from seedlings at the
Forest Reserve have failed.</p>

Tall spire-like trees, usually 2-3 dm. in diameter, rarely as large as
5 dm. in diameter; bark gray or reddish-brown, scaly; twigs slender,
smooth, light brown, becoming a dark gray brown; leaves scattered
along the shoots of the season, in fascicles on the older branches, usually
20-50 in a bundle; filiform, 1-2.5 cm. long, obtuse at apex, triangular
in cross-section, all falling off late in autumn; staminate flowers borne
on the short leafless branches, the pistillate appear with the leaves
on the branches of the previous season; cones borne on short, stout
branchlets, normally erect or inclined to be so, 10-20 mm. long, purplish
brown while growing, turning to a light brown at maturity, persisting
on the tree for about a year; wood hard, heavy, light brown, variable in
strength.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Labrador, Newfoundland south to southern New
York, West Virginia, northern Ohio and Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota
and northward. In Indiana it is confined to the northern part of
the State, and has not been reported south of the northern part of Cass
County. The most southern station in the eastern part of the State is
about Lake Everett in the northwest part of Allen County. It is found
on low borders of lakes, in swamps and in bogs. In all of its stations
in Indiana it is found growing near the water level in great depths of
organic matter more or less decomposed or in beds of peat, which contain
little or practically no soil. Where it is found, it usually forms a
pure stand.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Formerly the tamarack was a common tree in its area.
Recently many of the tamarack swamps have been drained. This
with heavy cutting has reduced the supply of tamarack in Indiana to
an insignificant amount. The tamarack is popularly classed as white
and yellow&mdash;the yellow being considered the better of the two. In our
area it is used principally for poles and posts. There is a diversity of
opinion as to the durability of tamarack in contact with the soil. The
most authentic information places the life of fence posts at about ten
years.</p>

southward on the mountains to northern Alabama. In Indiana it is
not found<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> north of Brown County. It is found in limited numbers at
the following places: on a bluff of Bean Blossom Creek in Brown
County; on a steep wooded slope on the south side of a small creek about
one and a half miles north of Borden in Clark County, and also reported
on the bank of Silver Creek between Clark and Floyd Counties; a few
trees on the top and sides of the cliffs about one mile east of Taswell in
Crawford County; a few trees on the bluff of Guthrie Creek in Jackson
County; a few trees along the north fork of the Muscatatuck River
between Vernon and North Vernon in Jennings County; a few trees
on the south bank of Back Creek near Leesville in Lawrence County;
frequent on the banks of Sugar Creek near the "Shades" in Montgomery
County; a few trees on the bank of Raccoon Creek in the
southern part of Owen County; frequent on the bank of Sugar Creek in
Turkey Run State Park in Parke County; a few trees on the banks of
Raccoon and Walnut Creeks in Putnam County. Also reported by
Beeler<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> as found on a bluff of White River in Morgan County.</p>

<p>In all of its stations it is found on sandstone bluffs on the south side
of streams, giving it a north or northwest exposure. In a few of the
stations there are no small trees, but in Montgomery County along Sugar
Creek it is reproducing well.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Hemlock is of no economic importance in Indiana.
The bark is much used in tanning. Hemlock is frequently used for a
hedge plant, also as a specimen tree in parks, etc.</p>

Large tall straight trees, up to 18 dm. in diameter and 45 m. high,
usually with a buttressed base which is frequently hollow. In wet
situations it develops steeple-shaped projections from the roots to
above the water level, known as "knees"; bark gray or reddish-brown,
separating from the trunk in long thin narrow strips; shoots light green,
smooth, turning reddish-brown the first year, then a darker brown;
leaves spirally arranged, appearing as if 2-ranked on vegetative shoots,
linear, 5-15 mm. long, sessile, acute, yellowish-green, turning brown in
the fall and dropping off; staminate flowers numerous, borne on long
terminal panicles, pistillate flowers solitary in the axils of the leaves;
fruit a cone, globose, about 2.5 cm. in diameter, the surface with some
wrinkles made by the edges of the closely fitting scales; wood light, soft
and straight-grained, rather weak, does not warp or shrink much and
reputed to be very durable when exposed to soil or weather.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Along the Atlantic coast from Delaware to Florida
and along the Gulf west to Texas and north along the Mississippi
Valley to Indiana. In Indiana it has a peculiar and limited distribution.
The mass distribution was just north and west of Decker in Knox
County. Collett<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> estimates that 20,000 acres were "covered with a
fine forest of cypress". Wright<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> maps the other places in the southern
part of Knox County where the cypress was known to have occurred.
At present the only cypress in Knox County is in the extreme southwest
part of the county, and is known as Little Cypress swamp. Here
it is associated with such trees as white elm and Schneck's oak. It is
believed that it extended only a few miles north of the Deshee
River. Going southward it has not been seen in Gibson County, and
is first noted in Posey County along the Wabash River in a cypress pond
about 12 miles southwest of Mt. Vernon. Then again in Posey County
along the Ohio River on the shores of Hovey Lake, and in a slough
about 3 miles east of Mt. Vernon. It occurred in a few spots in Vanderburg
County along the Ohio River southwest of Evansville. It again
appears in limited numbers along Cypress Creek a few miles east of
Newburg in Warrick County, which is its eastern<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> known limit.</p>

<p>The cypress in all of its stations is found only in places that are for
the greater part of the year under water.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;The original stand of cypress in Indiana has practically
all been cut, and the swamps drained and now under cultivation. In
the slough east of Mt. Vernon for several years, thousands of seedlings
of the year have been noted, but for some reason they do not survive a
second year. The present indications are that the cypress will be extinct
in Indiana before many years because practically no small trees
can be found.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;New Brunswick to Manitoba, south to Minnesota
and New Jersey thence southward along the Alleghanies to North
Carolina and Tennessee. In Indiana it is found native<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> only in Lake and
Porter Counties. In Lake County a few isolated specimens have been
found in several places near Lake Michigan. In Porter County it is
known only in a large tamarack swamp north of the Mineral Springs
stop on the Traction line, and about a mile from Lake Michigan.
Here about 100 trees are found scattered over an area of less than two
acres. The largest specimen measures 70 cm. in circumference. This
species is doomed to early extinction in our area. No doubt it already
has vanished from Lake County, and it is probable that the colony
north of Mineral Springs is the last of the species in Indiana.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;While only found in a swamp in Indiana, this species
adapts itself to all kinds of soils and exposures. It transplants readily
and is used for ornamental purposes, and for windbreaks. Dwarf forms
are frequently planted for hedges. The wood is used principally for
poles and posts, and is commercially known as white cedar.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Nova Scotia south to Florida, west to Texas and
north to South Dakota. It is found in all parts of Indiana, although
sparingly in the northern part, especially where streams with bluffs are
absent. No doubt this species in the original forests was confined principally
to the bluffs of streams and rocky ravines. Since the forests have
been cut, it is now found growing along fences, in open dry woods, and
in southern Indiana it is a common tree in old abandoned fields, and in
waste places.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Red cedar has had many uses, and the large trees have
been practically all harvested. It is now used principally for poles,
posts, crossties, cigar boxes and lead pencils. It is the best wood known
for lead pencils. The odor is so objectionable to insects that a market
has been made for chests of this wood in which to store clothing and
furs.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;New Brunswick and New England, westward to the
eastern part of the Great Plains area from North Dakota to Texas,
and, in some forms, westward across that State and into Mexico. It is
interesting that this species, the first willow published in America, in
the first book on American Botany ever published in this country,
should be abundantly and widely distributed in the United States.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Along the Atlantic Coast from Connecticut to
Florida and along the Gulf to Louisiana, and northward along the

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;The cottonwood is adapted to a moist soil, propagates
easily, grows rapidly and is one of the best trees for forestry purposes
for planting overflow lands, and for planting where a quick shade is
desired or for temporary windbreaks.</p>

<p>The leaves of this tree are quite variable and several forms have
been described. The Carolina poplar of nurserymen has an upright
habit of growth and was formerly much planted as a shade tree. Its
undesirable qualities have condemned it, and most cities now prohibit
its planting.</p>

<p>Cottonwood has many uses, and was formerly a very important
timber tree, but the supply has so diminished that large trees have
become quite scarce. The thick bark was much used by the boys of
the pioneers for whittling out toys, etc.</p>

<span class="smcap">Large-toothed Aspen.</span> <a href="#Plate_18">Plate 18.</a>
A small or medium-sized tree, 1-4 dm. in diameter; bark
smooth, grayish-green or whitish, becoming furrowed and dark brown on
the trunks of old trees that grow in the northern part of the State,
especially when growing in a swampy habitat. In the southern part of the
State where the tree usually grows on the top of hills, the bark does not
darken so much, frequently remaining a light to dark gray until maturity.
Shoots more or less woolly at first, becoming glabrous, reddish-brown;
leaves on sprouts and very young trees very velvety beneath, slightly
hairy above, ovate in outline, cordate at base and with blades up to 20
cm. in length; leaves on older trees a yellow green, glabrous, ovate,
blades usually 6-10 cm. long, coarsely and unevenly toothed, the base
slightly rounded, rarely truncate or slightly cordate, the apex pointed
or rounded; petioles strongly flattened laterally; stamens 6-12; capsule
about 5 mm. long on a stalk about 1 mm. long; wood soft, light and not
strong.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Nova Scotia west to northern Minnesota and south
to the Ohio River, and along the Alleghany Mountains to South Carolina.
Found throughout Indiana, except we have no authentic records
for Gibson<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and Posey<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Counties. In the northern part of Indiana it is
found in great colonies about lakes, etc. or rarely a few trees on the
crests of gravel and sand ridges. In southern Indiana it is found in the
"knob" area in small colonies on the tops of the ridges associated with
scrub pine and chestnut oak and is rarely found in low ground in this
part of the State.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This species is too rare to be of much economic importance.
It could be most profitably used for excelsior and pulp wood.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Valley of the St. Lawrence River south to the Gulf
States and west to Nebraska. Found in all parts of Indiana, although
very sparingly in some counties. It is an infrequent tree in our range,
and in only a few localities is it frequent or common. It is found along
streams and in ravines, and in two instances it has been noted in old
tamarack marshes. It prefers a well drained gravelly soil, and is rarely
if ever found in a compact soil.</p>

<p>Thrifty trees of any size in the woodland are now rarely seen. The
tops of the larger trees are usually found in a more or less dying condition.
Benedict and Elrod<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> as early as 1892 make the following
observation in a catalogue of the plants of Cass and Wabash Counties:
"A few scrubby, half dead trees were seen, the last of their race. It
seems unable to adapt itself to new conditions, and is rapidly dying
out."</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This tree is often called the white walnut to distinguish
it from the black walnut from which it is easily separated. It is too
rare in Indiana to be of economic importance, except that trees growing
in the open are spared for the nut crop. Trees growing in the open
develop a short trunk with a wide spreading top and are apparently
much healthier than when grown under forest conditions. The bark
of the root is used in medicine as a hepatic stimulant.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Ontario south to the Gulf States and west to Texas
and Nebraska. It was more or less frequent to common in all parts of
Indiana in well drained rich soils.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This tree is frequently called black walnut. On account
of the many excellent qualities of the wood, the walnut has been a
choice timber tree from pioneer days to the present. It served the
pioneer for rails, and in his buildings for sleepers, rafters, interior
finish, furniture, etc. It soon sprung into commercial importance, and
has been used for almost everything for which wood is used. Indiana
and Ohio have furnished the greatest amount of walnut. The supply of
lumber from old forest-grown trees has become so scarce that it is sought
in old buildings, rail fences, old stumps and old furniture has been worked
over. That the demand for walnut timber will not cease is assured; this
should encourage land owners to grow this tree. It is adapted to a
moist, rich, deep soil and will do well in such a habitat in all parts of the
State. Where such land is set aside for forestry purposes, no better tree
could be used for planting. Since the tree develops a long tap root which
makes it difficult to transplant, it is recommended that the nuts be
stratified in the fall, and the germinated nuts be planted in April or
May. The foliage of the walnut is often attacked by the "tent caterpillar"
which can be easily destroyed by burning about sun down when
the larvæ collect in a bunch on or near the trunk of the tree. Since
the nut of the walnut is of considerable commercial value, it is recommended
that the walnut be planted along fences, about orchards and as
one of the species in windbreaks.</p>

Township of Posey County, and in the bottoms of the southwest part
of Gibson County. It was found more or less frequently in the bottoms
of the Wabash Valley, as far north as to within four miles of Covington
where the author collected specimens in 1918. It followed the bottoms
of the Ohio River east at least as far as Clark County. Michaux<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
gives it as rare in the vicinity of Louisville. Victor Lyons of Jeffersonville
says that it was a native to the east part of Survey 29 of the Illinois
Grant, and one tree in the northwest corner of No. 32; and there were
nine trees 9-10 dm. in diameter in Floyd County on "Loop Island".

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>There are several trees on the Elisha Golay farm about one mile
east of Vevay which are in rows, which show that they were planted.
The largest has a trunk 2.2 m. long and a circumference of 31 dm.
It followed the north fork of White River as far as Greene County,
and the south fork of White River as far as Seymour. A pioneer told
me he remembered a small colony in the eastern part of Washington
County in the bottoms near the Muscatatuck River. In Indiana
it is found only in very low land which is subject to overflow.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;So far as the wood is concerned, the pecan is the poorest
of all hickories. It has only about one-half the strength and stiffness
of the shellbark hickory. Although the wood is inferior, the pecan has
the distinction of producing the best nut of any native tree of America.
The pecan was well known to the Indians, and some authors say the
range of the species was extended by planting by the Indians. It has
been a nut of commerce ever since the area of its range has been settled.
It was planted by the pioneers, and recently nurserymen took up the
subject of growing stock by budding and grafting from superior trees.
At present there are about 100 horticultural varieties. The horticulturist
has developed forms twice the size of the native nuts, and with
shells so thin as to be styled "paper-shelled." The pecan has been extensively
planted for commercial purposes in the southern states, but
information obtained from owners of pecan trees in Indiana indicate
that the winters are too severe for profitable pecan culture in Indiana.
During the winter of 1917-18 the whole of a tract of 13 year old pecan
trees on the Forest Reserve in Clark County was killed back to the
ground. In Noble County about one mile south of Wolf Lake is a tree
planted about 50 years ago that is about 9 dm. in circumference that
frequently sets nuts but they never mature on account of the early
frosts.</p>

cm. in width, and the last pair almost as large; fruit subglobose or rarely
oblong, 2-3.5 cm. long; wings of sutures extending to below the middle,
rarely one reaching the base; husk about 1.5 mm. thick, tardily
separating to about the middle; nut ovoid or oblong, slightly flattened

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Valley of the St. Lawrence River west to Nebraska
and south to the Gulf States. In Indiana a map distribution of the
species in the State shows that it has been found in practically all of the
counties on the west, north and east borders. It is usually found
in rich soil along streams and in rich woods, and may be found in all
of the counties of the State. Despite the fact that no animal agency
was active against the propagation of this tree, it was rarely found
more than as an infrequent tree throughout our range.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;The hickories as a class, except the pecan, can not stand
"civilization," especially much tramping about the base. It appears
that the pignut hickory is the most easily affected. In Parke County
about Coxville great numbers of the trees have been killed by the borers.
For the uses of the wood see shellbark hickory. Since this species
does not produce as much marketable lumber as the shellbark hickory,
and the nuts are valueless, it should not be recommended for planting
in the farmer's woodlot. The rossed bark of this species is preferred
by manufacturers of split-bottomed chairs, and is known by them as
"yellow-bud" hickory.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Quebec west to southern Minnesota, Kansas and
eastern Texas, thence eastward to the Atlantic through the north part
of the Gulf States. It is frequent to common in all parts of Indiana
except on the hills of the southern part. It prefers rich moist soil and
is generally found in bottom lands or on rolling land, and if in dryer
situations on the sides of hills. It is generally associated with red oak,
big shellbark hickory, swamp white oak, sweet gum, linn, white ash,
slippery elm, sugar maple, beech, etc. In the forest it is a tall straight
tree with few main branches for a crown. No tree carries its taper
better than this species. When grown in the open the side branches do
not shade off, and it grows to a medium height with a wide spreading
crown.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;The writer has one specimen from Wells County which
no doubt should be referred to this species, but the description has not
been drawn to cover it. The twigs are very slender and pubescent; the
leaves are normal and pubescent; the fruit is obovoid, 2-4 cm. long; husk
less than 1 mm. thick at outer end and 2 mm. thick at the base; nut
obovoid, 1-8 cm. long, little compressed, rounded at the base, rounded
at the apex, slightly angled, angles obscure on lower half; otherwise
as the type.</p>

<p>The species is very variable and no dependence can be placed upon
such characters as pubescence of the twigs, leaves or fruit, size of the
twigs, color of the anthers, size or shape of the nuts.</p>

<p>The wood of the shellbark and the big shellbark hickories is the most
used of all the hickories because it is generally freer from knots and
blemishes. Hickory is used principally for carriage and wagon stock,
agricultural implements, handles and fuel. The supply of hickory is
fast waning, and in the near future will be limited.</p>

<p>The hickories are very slow growing trees. They develop a long tap
root, hence are hard to transplant. Hickory should constitute an important
part of the woodlot. If this species is not well represented,
germinated nuts should be planted. The nut of this species usually
sells for $3.00 to $5.00 per bushel, which should encourage land owners
to plant it in the open along fences and about the orchard. It should
be remembered that hickory will not stand much tramping by stock.</p>

and hard-head hickory. The nuts are an article of commerce and by
some are preferred to the shellbark hickory although the nuts are hard
to crack. This objection is easily overcome by wetting the nuts, and
drying them by using heat which cracks the shell, making them easy to
crack.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Southern Ontario south to the Gulf States and west
to Texas and Iowa. This species is reported for all parts of the State.
However, the records for the northern counties were made when this
species was not separated from <i>Carya ovalis</i>, and since the latter species
is quite frequent in the northern counties it is best to refer the early
records to <i>Carya ovalis</i>. The most northern station based upon an existing
specimen is the north side of the Mississinewa River east of Eaton
in Delaware County. It is a frequent, common to very common tree
on the hills in the southern part of the State. It has its mass distribution
in the unglaciated part of the State, although it is locally a frequent
to a common tree of the hills of the other southern counties. It appears
that this species has the ability to invade areas after the virgin
forest is cut, and it is not an uncommon sight to see this species
in almost pure stands on the hills of cut-over lands.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This species is often called pignut. Sargent wisely
suggests that this name be used exclusively for <i>Carya cordiformis</i>. The
great abundance of this species in Brown, Morgan and Monroe Counties
has been instrumental in building up a large business in the manufacture
of hickory chairs and furniture. Frames of furniture are made from the
very young trees, and backs and seats from the bark of old trees, which
are cut, stripped of their bark, and often left to rot.</p>

<p>Sargent<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> has described five varieties of this species, three of which
he credits to Indiana. The writer has sent him specimens from over
100 trees of this species, and he has variously distributed them to the
type and varieties. Heimlich has reported Sargent's determination of
many of these specimens in the Proc. Ind. Acad. Science, 1917:436-439:1918.
The writer cannot agree with the determinations and believes
further field study is necessary to discover characters by which the
several forms can consistently be divided.</p>

<p>To stimulate the study of this species, the original description of the
varieties together with Sargent's characterization of the type are quoted
because they are contained in a book not usually found in libraries.
To these descriptions are added new characters which Sargent gives in
his revision of the hickories in Bot. Gaz. 66:245-247:1918.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"In the shape of the fruit and in the thickness of its involucre this
tree is of four distinct forms; in all of them the involucre splits freely
to the base, or nearly to the base, the shell of the nut is thin and the
seed, although small, is sweet and edible. The extremes of these forms
are very distinct, but there are forms which are intermediate between
them, so that it is difficult to decide sometimes to which of the forms
these intermediate forms should be referred. The first of these forms,
as the fruit agrees with Wangenheim's figure, must be considered the
type of the species. The fruit is oval, narrowed and rounded at the base,
acute at the apex, usually from 2.5-3 cm. long and about 1.5 cm. in
diameter. The involucre is from 2-2.5 mm. thick and occasionally one
of the sutures remains closed. The nut is oblong, slightly flattened,
rounded at the base, acute or acuminate and four-angled at the apex,
the ridges extending for one-third or rarely for one-half of its length,

and usually from 1.3-1.5 cm. in diameter. The involucre varies from
1-1.5 mm. in thickness and splits freely to the base by distinctly winged
sutures. The nut is rounded or acute at the base with a short point,
rounded at the apex, very slightly or not at all ridged, pale colored,
from 1.2-1.5 cm. long and wide and from 1-1.2 cm. thick."</p>

Gaz. 66:246:1918. This is a form described from a specimen collected
by the author on the border of Dan's Pond in Knox County. It differs
from "the variety <i>obcordata</i> in the thick tomentose covering of the
branchlets during their first year. The leaves of this form are slightly
pubescent in the autumn on the under surface of the midribs. Although
the nuts are more compressed than those of the ordinary forms of var.
<i>obcordata</i>, the fruit is of that variety. The branchlets are unusually
stout for a form of <i>Carya ovalis</i> and are covered with rusty tomentum
during their first year and are more or less pubescent in their second
and third seasons."</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Western New York west to Illinois and south to
North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas and Missouri.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
The species is found in all parts of the State, although the distribution
of the varieties has not been worked out. The habitat of
this species is high ground, and only rarely is it found in low ground.
It prefers hills, slopes, base of the terraces of streams, and in the
northern part of the State gravelly ridges and sandy soil. In all of its
range it is usually associated with white and black oak. It is infrequent
in the southern part of the State but north of the Wabash
River it becomes more frequent and in some places it becomes common
to very common. It is a common tree in Wells County north of the
Wabash River and in the northern part of Lagrange County, and in
both places a wide range of forms occur, some of which are not covered
by the preceding description. No one of our trees offers a better opportunity
for intensive study than this hickory.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Text books call this species the small-fruited hickory.
It is not commonly distinguished from the other hickories, but in
Wells County where it is common the boys call it "Ladies' Hickory."</p>

bark smooth and light brown on small trees, shreddy on older trees;
shoots hairy, becoming at the end of the season glabrous or nearly so
and a reddish-brown; leaves oblong-ovate, other forms rare, average
size about 7-12 cm. long, acuminate, usually double-serrate, hairy on
both surfaces when they unfold, glabrous or nearly so above at maturity,
more or less pubescent beneath, especially on the midrib and veins;

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Nova Scotia west to Manitoba, south to the Gulf
States and west to Texas. It is frequent to common in all of the
counties of the State. However, it is entirely absent in the lower
Wabash bottoms, except rarely on high grounds in this area. It
prefers well drained dry soil, and is most frequent when it is associated
with beech and sugar maple, although it is often quite plentiful in white
oak woods. It is shade enduring and is one of the under trees in the
forest where it grows very tall and slender and free from branches.
When it grows in exposed places such as bluffs, it retains its side
branches and is usually bushy.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;The trees are too small to be of much economic importance.
It is 30 per cent stronger than white oak, and 46 per cent more
elastic. These exceptional qualities were recognized by the Indians and
it was used by them where wood of great strength and hardness was
desired. Likewise the pioneer used it where he could for handles,
wooden wedges, etc. Since it grows neither large nor fast, it is usually
regarded as a weed tree in the woodland, and should be removed to give

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;The distribution of this species is variously given
as from Newfoundland west to Manitoba and south in the Alleghenies
to Georgia. It is now definitely known that the species of <i>Betula</i>
hybridize which may account for the peculiar forms often encountered.
That there are geographic races or Mendelian segregates of this species
is evidenced by the different interpretations given this species by different
authors. <i>Betula alleghanensis</i> Britton appears to be one of them.
The descriptive difference between <i>Betula lenta</i> and <i>Betula lutea</i> is not
clear, which has resulted in many authors crediting <i>Betula lenta</i> to
Indiana and the area west of Indiana.</p>

<p>The preceding description does not agree with that of <i>Betula lutea</i>
exactly, and has been drawn to cover the specimens at hand from Indiana
which the author has from Allen, Crawford, Lagrange, Lake,
Marshall, Porter and Steuben Counties. It has recently been reported
from White County by Heimlich.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> He says: "Specimens were taken
from two trees about two miles south of Buffalo near the water's edge
of the river." The writer has visited this locality and found here, and
also on the island above the bridge a little farther down the river,
<i>Betula nigra</i>, but could not find <i>Betula lutea</i>. Since Heimlich did not
report <i>Betula nigra</i>, which unmistakably occurs here, I assume he has
confused the two species. It is very local in its distribution, and appears
to be confined to swamps, borders of lakes, and streams in the
extreme northern part of the State. It has not been seen south of the
northern end of the State, except a few small trees found clinging
to the walls of the cliffs of a ravine about one mile east of Taswell
in Crawford County. The walls of this ravine are about 25 meters
high; associated with it were a few trees of hemlock, and on the top
of the cliffs, laurel (<i>Kalmia latifolia</i>).</p>

<p>Large trees of this species in Indiana are usually from 4-6 dm. in
diameter and about 15 m. high. The number in any one station is
usually few, although there were formerly patches where it was plentiful.
Van Gorder<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> reports for Noble County <i>Betula lenta</i> which should be
transferred to this species, and he says: "There is a marsh of several
acres of birch in Section 15 of York Township." The largest area now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
known is that contained in the large tamarack swamp near Mineral
Springs in Porter County. In this swamp are found tamarack and
white cedar. It was in this swamp that the writer found a peculiar
form of birch which has been determined as <i>Betula Sandbergi</i>. Since
this species<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> is recognized as a hybrid of <i>Betula papyrifera</i> and <i>Betula
pumila</i> variety <i>glandulifera</i>, and the last parent of this hybrid is not
found in the vicinity, a discussion of this form is not presented. In
the immediate vicinity are found only <i>Betula lutea</i> and <i>Betula pumila</i>.
<i>Betula papyrifera</i> is found about a mile distant to the south. It is
assumed that this form is a cross between <i>Betula lutea</i> and <i>Betula pumila</i>.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Nova Scotia west to southern Ontario and south to
Delaware and Pennsylvania. In Indiana it has been reported from
Lake, Laporte, Porter, St. Joseph and Tippecanoe Counties. There
may be some doubt about the Tippecanoe record, since many of the
older records were made from cultivated trees. The numbers of the
species in Indiana were always limited. It is not able to meet changed
conditions and it has already almost disappeared from our area. I
was told that formerly this species was found all about a lake in Laporte
County, but it has all died out. Its appearance in Indiana is peculiar
since it is not found west of us, or north in Michigan or east in Ohio.
This small group of trees near Lake Michigan is three or four hundred
miles from the nearest of their kind.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This species is called white and gray birch. The
largest tree seen in Indiana was about 2 dm. in diameter and 13 m. high.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Massachusetts west to Minnesota and south to
Florida and Texas. In Indiana it is found more or less frequent in the
counties bordering the Kankakee River, and as far east as St. Joseph,
Marshall and Miami Counties. Along the Kankakee River it is frequently
a tree of 6-8 dm. in diameter. This species has not been found
in Michigan, northeastern Indiana or northern Ohio. It has never been
noted near Lake Michigan, and the nearest point is Cedar Lake in Lake
County about 20 miles south of the Lake. It is more or less frequent
along certain streams throughout the southwestern part of the State.
It is found as far north as Putnam and Marion Counties and eastward
as far as Bartholomew, Scott and Clark Counties. There are no
records for this species for eastern Indiana or western Ohio. About
Hovey Lake in Posey County it reaches its greatest size, where trees
up to 8 dm. in diameter and 30 m. high are to be found. In the "flats"
in certain parts of Jackson and Scott Counties it becomes a common
tree, associated with pin oak and sweet gum.</p>

other species are too rare to be of economic importance. The fact that
other species of birch are so rare in Indiana, is the reason that this

birch and river birch. The principal use of this wood in this State is
for heading.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Newfoundland to the Saskatchewan, south to New
York, northeastern Ohio, northern Indiana and Nebraska. In Indiana
it is confined to the northern tier of counties. I have specimens from
Elkhart, Lagrange, Lake and Porter Counties. It was reported from
Carroll County by Thompson, but in the absence of a verifying specimen
I am inclined to think this citation should be referred to <i>Alnus</i>
<i>rugosa</i>. This species grows in low ground on the borders of
streams, borders of swamps and in almost extinct sloughs near
Lake Michigan. It is also found along Pigeon River in the eastern part
of Lagrange County. In the vicinity of Mineral Springs in Porter
County it is locally a common shrub or tree. It has the habit of stooling
out, and commonly the several specimens will be deflected from a vertical
from 20-45 degrees. The largest specimens are from 1-1.4 dm. in
diameter and about 10 m. high.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This species could be used to good advantage in ornamental
planting in low ground. It grows rapidly, is easily transplanted
and its foliage is dense and attractive.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Maine to Minnesota, south to Florida and Texas.
In Indiana it is quite local. It has been reported in many of the
counties of northern Indiana north of the Wabash River. It has been
found in several of the southern counties and as far north as Salt Creek
in Monroe County. No reports for the central part of the State. It
is absent also in all of the eastern counties of the State, and the western
part of Ohio. It is found growing in clumps in wet woods, swamps,
cold bogs and along streams. It is usually a tall slender shrub; however,
a specimen has been seen that measured 7 cm. in diameter and 5 m.
in height.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Nova Scotia, southern Ontario to Wisconsin, south
to the Gulf States and Texas. It is found in every county of the State,
although it is local in the prairie and dry sandy regions of the northwestern
part of the State. It is a frequent to a very common tree on the
high ground in many parts of the State. If the high ground and hills
of the State are not forested with white and black oak, beech is almost
certain to be the prevailing species. Wherever beech is found it is
usually a frequent to a common tree, and it is not uncommon to see
areas which are almost a pure stand of this species. It is also a frequent
to a common tree in southern Indiana in what is called the
"flats." Here it is associated with sweet gum and pin oak. On the
slopes of hills of the southern counties it is associated with a great
variety of trees. In the central part of the State its most frequent
associate is the sugar maple. In the northern counties it has a wider
range of associates, including white oak, ash, slippery elm, buckeye,
ironwood, etc. It should be added that tulip is a constant associate
except in the "flats." In point of number it ranks as first of Indiana
trees.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Specimens with the habit of retaining their branches
which lop downward, usually have thicker sap wood and are harder to
split. This form is popularly styled the white beech. The form with
smooth tall trunks with upright branches usually has more heart wood,
splits more easily and is popularly distinguished as red beech. The term
yellow beech is variously applied. This species is a large tree in all
parts of the State, although the largest specimens are found in the
southeastern part of the State. In the virgin forests trees almost 1
m. in diameter and 30 m. high were frequent.</p>

<p>Beech was formerly used only for fuel, but in the last few decades
it has been cut and used for many purposes, and the supply is fast
diminishing. The beauty of this tree both in summer and winter,
sunshine or storm makes it one of the most desirable for shade tree
planting, but I have failed to find where it has been successfully used.
It is one of the few trees that does not take to domestication. When
the original forest is reduced to a remnant of beech, as a rule, the
remaining beech will soon begin to die at the top. It is difficult to
transplant. When planted the hole should be filled with earth obtained
from under a living tree, in order to introduce the mycorrhiza
that is necessary to the growth of the tree.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Maine, southern Ontario, Michigan, south to Delaware
and in the mountains to Alabama, and west to Arkansas. In
Indiana it is found locally in the south central counties. The most
northern station where I have seen trees that are native to a certainty
is in Morgan County a short distance north of Martinsville. There
are a few trees on the south bank of White River in Mound Park about
2 miles east of Anderson. This site was formerly an Indian village, and
the trees may have been introduced here. The late A. C. Benedict
formerly of the State Geological Survey, told me he saw a colony in
1878 in Fayette County on the farm of Dr. B. Ball, about 3 miles west
of Connersville on the east side of Little Williams Creek. The trees
were at least 6 dm. in diameter. The western line of distribution would
be a line drawn from Martinsville to a point a few miles west of Shoals
and south to Tell City.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;The greatest numbers of this species are found on the
outcrops of the knobstone in Clark, Floyd, Harrison, Jackson, Lawrence,
Martin, Orange and Washington Counties. It grows on high ground,
associated with white and black oak, beech, etc. The species in all of
our area grows to be a large tree. In the Ind. Geol. Rept. 1874:70:1875
there is a reference to a "stump in Jackson County that was 9 ft. and
2 in. in diameter." This species is rather gregarious in habit, and
rarely are isolated trees found. It is quite local in its distribution,
but where found it is usually a common tree. The bark was much used
in tanning, and the timber for poles, ties and posts. The demand for
this species has led to heavy cutting, so that the present supply is practically
limited to inferior or small trees. The nut crop in this State
is usually badly infested by the weevil.</p>

<p>This species is easily propagated by seed or seedlings. It is recommended
for forest planting in all parts of its natural range and other
parts of the State where the soil is very sandy and free from limestone.
This species never attains to an old age when growing close to the
limestone. It grows rapidly and requires little pruning. The only
objection to planting it for forestry purposes is that it might be infested
by the chestnut bark disease which is fatal to this tree. This
disease is far to the east of us, and there are wide barriers to its western
migration. Since a chestnut grove would soon grow into post and
pole size, in the event the grove would be killed by the bark disease,
the crop could be harvested and the loss would be more of the nature
of a disappointment than a financial one. If planted in a cleared area
the seedlings should be spaced about 5×5 feet if no cultivation can
be done. If the trees can be cultivated, plant 7×7 or 8×8 feet and
grow corn for one or two years between the rows.</p>


<p class="caption2nb"><a name="QUERCUS" id="QUERCUS"></a><b>3. QUÉRCUS.</b> <span class="smcap">The Oaks.</span></p>

<p>The leaves of Indiana oaks are deciduous; flowers appear in April
or May, very small, the staminate on slender pendulous catkins, the
pistillate solitary or in clusters in scaly bud-like cups; fruit an acorn
which takes one or two years to mature, ripening in September or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
October. The species that mature their fruit the first year are popularly
and commercially classed as "white oaks." Those that mature
their fruit the second year are classed as "red, black or bristle-tipped
oaks."</p>

<p>The oaks are the largest genus of Indiana trees, and commercially
are the most important of all trees of the State. They are the longest
lived of all the trees that occur in the State, and while they have
numerous insect enemies none of them prove fatal to it, except a certain
gall insect.</p>

<p>Note:&mdash;In collecting leaf specimens of oaks for identification it
should be borne in mind that the foliage is quite variable. The leaves
of seedlings, coppice shoots and of vigorous shoots of old trees sometimes
vary considerably in size, form and leaf-margins. Also leaves of
old trees that grow in the shade usually have the margins more nearly
entire than the typical leaves. For example leaves may be found on
the lower and interior branches of a pin oak which are not lobed to
beyond the middle, which throws them into the red oak group.</p>

<p><a name="Quercus_alba" id="Quercus_alba"></a><b>1. Quercus álba</b> Linnæus. <span class="smcap">White Oak.</span>
<a href="#Plate_40">Plate 40.</a> Large
trees with gray, fissured bark, flaky on the branches, on the upper part
of the trunks of some trees the bark loosens at the fissures and peels
back, forming flat strips which remain attached at one side; twigs at
first hairy, becoming smooth; leaves mostly obovate in outline, generally
8-20 cm. long on petioles 0.5-2 cm. long, more or less deeply lobed into
5-9 lobes, the lobes ascending and generally blunt and entire, sometimes
the lobes have one or two secondary lobes, leaves narrowed and oblique
at the base, smooth above, smooth and glaucous beneath; acorns sessile
or on stalks up to 2 cm. long; nuts quite variable on different trees
as to size and shape, ovoid or oblong, 18-30 mm. long; cup flat on the
bottom, tuberculate and encloses about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> of the nut; scales blunt and
woolly.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Maine, southern Ontario, Minnesota south to
Florida and Texas. Found in all parts of Indiana. In point of number
it is exceeded only by the beech, although it has a more general distribution.
It is adapted to many types of soil, and is found in almost all
situations in Indiana except in very wet soils. It is sparingly found
in the sand dune area. On the clay soils of the northern part of the
State it is a frequent to an abundant tree, and in the southern part of
the State it often forms complete stands on the slopes of the hills.</p>

<p>The white oak is one of the largest and possibly the longest lived
tree of Indiana. While it is able to adapt itself to many situations,
it grows to the largest size in a porous, moist and rich soil.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Wood heavy, hard, close-grained, tough, strong and
durable. On account of its abundance, and wide range of uses, it has
always been the most important timber tree of Indiana.</p>

<p>Formerly the woods were full of white oak 1-1.5 meters (3-5 ft.) in
diameter, but today trees of a meter (3 ft.) in diameter with long
straight trunks are rare indeed. Michaux who traveled extensively in
America 1801-1807, while the whole Mississippi Valley was yet a wilderness,
remarks: "The white oak is the most valuable tree in America."
He observed the ruthless destruction of this valuable tree, and
predicted that the supply would soon be depleted, and that America
would be sorry that regulations were not adopted to conserve the supply
of this valuable tree. Michaux's prediction has come true, and yet no
constructive measures have been provided to insure the Nation an adequate
supply of this timber. It should be remembered that it requires
two to three hundred years to grow a white oak a meter in diameter,
and if we are to have white oak of that size in the next generation the
largest of our present stand must be spared for that harvest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>White oak was formerly much used in construction work, but it has
become so costly that cheaper woods take its place. At present it is
used principally in cooperage, interior finish, wagon and car stock,
furniture, agricultural implements, crossties, and veneer. Indiana has
the reputation of furnishing the best grade of white oak in the world.</p>

<p>Little attention has been given this valuable species either in horticultural
or forestal planting. This no doubt is due in a great measure
to the slow growth of the tree. It should be used more for shade tree,
ornamental and roadside tree planting. There are good reasons why
white oak should be much used in reforestation. The cheapest and
most successful method of propagating white oak is to plant the seed
in the places where the trees are desired to grow. This is best done by
planting the acorns as soon as they fall or are mature. The best results
will be obtained if the nuts are planted with the small end down, and
covered about an inch deep with earth. If the ground is a hard clay
soil and the small end of the nut is placed down a half inch of earth on
the nut is sufficient. Rodents often destroy the nuts, and if this
danger is apprehended it is best to poison the rodents or to stratify the
seed, or grow seedlings and plant them when they are one year old. In
forestal planting it is suggested that the planting be 4×4 feet.</p>

<p>The white oak is quite variable in the lobing of the leaves, and in
size and shape of the fruit, and in the length of its peduncle. The
variable lobing of the leaves has lead several authors to describe varieties
based on this character. The latest is that of Sargent<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> who describes:
"The trees with leaves less deeply divided, with broad rounded
lobes and usually smaller generally sessile fruit," as <b>Quercus alba</b>
variety <b>latiloba</b>.</p>

<p><a name="Quercus_alba_M" id="Quercus_alba_M"></a><b>Quercus alba × Muhlenbérgii</b> (× <i>Quercus Deami</i> Trelease). This
rare hybrid was discovered in a woods about 3 miles northwest of
Bluffton Indiana by L. A. Williamson and his son E. B. Williamson in
1904.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The tree is still standing and in 1918 bore a heavy crop of seed. A
liberal quantity was sent for propagation to the Arnold Arboretum,
New York Botanical Gardens, and Missouri Botanical Gardens. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Arboretum succeeded in germinating several seed. The New York
Gardens succeeded in getting 5 seedlings. The Missouri Gardens failed
to get any to germinate. About a gallon of seeds was planted in the
Clark County State forest nursery and all failed.</p>

it is usually associated with pin and bur oak, and white elm; in the flats
of the southeastern part of the State it is usually associated with cow
oak and sweet gum, while in the southwestern counties it is found most

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Vermont, southwestern Ontario to Wisconsin and
south to Florida and west to Texas. Found in limited numbers in all
parts of Indiana, although Hill's record for Lake county is the only
record in the block of the 12 northwest counties. It is without a doubt
found in every county south of the Wabash River. It is a rare or an
infrequent tree in practically all parts of its range. It is generally found
on the dry banks of streams, river terrace banks, rocky bluffs of streams,
and only rarely in level dry woods. In the southern counties it is
sometimes found on clay or rocky ridges. In most of its range it is
now so rare that most of the inhabitants do not know the tree.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Wood similar to white oak, and with the same uses.</p>

<p>In White County a pioneer was found who knew the tree only by
the name of pigeon oak. He said it received this name from the fact
that the wild pigeons were fond of the acorns.</p>

<p>The leaves of this tree vary greatly in size, shape, and leaf margins.
The fruit also varies on different trees in the shape of the nut, and
the depth of the cup. These variations have lead some authors to
separate the forms and one histological study<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> seems to support minor
differences. It has been observed that the leaves in the top of some
trees may be thick, narrow and with long incurved teeth, while the
leaves of the lower branches will be strongly obovate, thinner, and the
teeth more dentate. In a general study it is best to include the polymorphic
forms under one name. The distribution of the shallow
and deep cup forms is so general that no regional or habitat areas can
be assigned to either of them in Indiana.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Delaware, southern Indiana, Missouri, south to
Florida and west to Texas. In Indiana it is believed that its distribution
is pretty well known and well defined. It is an inhabitant of low
wet woods, although large trees may be found in fairly dry woods which
have been made dry by drainage. In discussing the distribution it must
be remembered that this species was reported as <i>Quercus Prinus</i> before
the sixth edition of Gray's Manual which was published in 1890.
Gorby's<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> reference to Miami County should be ignored, because he
compiled his list of trees from a list of common names to which he
appended the scientific names. His list includes several species which
are not native, and his water willow (<i>Dianthera americana</i>) is an herbaceous
plant. Wilson's<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> report for Hamilton County I believe also
to be an error. Wilson preserved no specimen. Since Hamilton County
has no cow oak habitat, and Wilson was not acquainted with the
species, I think this reference should be transferred to the broad-leaf
form of <i>Quercus Muhlenbergii</i>. The author has collected and
distributed authentic specimens from a point 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> miles southwest of
Napoleon in Ripley County. This species is reported by Meyncke for
Franklin County as scarce, and by Collins for Dearborn County. Since
the habitat of the species is found in these counties, it is fair to admit
them into the range of the species. This species is a frequent to a very
common tree in the flats of Clark, Scott, Jefferson, Jackson, Jennings,
and Ripley Counties, where it is usually associated with beech and
sweet gum. It is now known to range as far north as the northern parts
of Jackson, Jennings and Ripley Counties. It is an infrequent tree of
the Lower Wabash Valley as far north as southern Knox County and
no doubt followed eastward along White River. It follows the Ohio
River eastward at least to a point six miles east of Grandview in Spencer
County. It no doubt was an occasional tree along the Ohio River up
to Dearborn County. It has also been reported by Aiken for Hamilton
County, Ohio. In the Lower Wabash Valley it is associated with
Spanish and pin oak.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Wood and uses similar to white oak. In the flats of
southeastern Indiana it is generally called white oak, and in some
places it is known as bur oak. It grows very rapidly and to a large size.
A tree was measured in 1919 in the Klein woods about 4 miles north of
North Vernon that was 3.57 meters (11 feet, 7 inches) in circumference,
breast high, and was estimated to be 15 m. (50 feet) to the first branch.</p>

<p>This species when grown in the open forms a large oval head, and in
moist soil would make one of the best shade and roadside trees to be had.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
It is not known how it would adapt itself to high ground, but it is
believed this species is worthy a trial as a shade tree. It is apparently
hardy in the northern counties.</p>

<p><b>Quercus Bèadlei</b> Trelease. (<i>Quercus alba × Michauxii</i>). This hybrid
between the white and cow oak was found by the writer in 1913 in
the White River bottoms 3 miles east of Medora in Jackson County.</p>

<p>The tree measured 3.54 meters (139 inches) in circumference breast
high. Specimens were distributed under No. 19,037, and the determination
was made by William Trelease, our leading authority on oaks.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Maine, northern shore of Lake Erie, to west central
Indiana and south to northern Georgia and Alabama. In Indiana its
distribution is limited to the knobstone and sandstone area of the State.
Its distribution has been fairly well mapped. Two large trees on the
edge of the top of the bluff of the Ohio River at Marble Hill which is
located in the south corner of Jefferson County is the eastern limit of its
range. It crowns some of the ridges, sometimes extending down the
adjacent slopes a short distance, from Floyd County north to the south
side of Salt Creek in Brown County. Its range then extends west to the
east side of Monroe County, thence southwestward to the west side of
Martin County, thence south to the Ohio River. Where it is found it is
generally such a common tree that the areas are commonly called
chestnut oak ridges and are regarded as our poorest and most stony land.
In Floyd and Clark counties it is usually associated with scrub pine.
In the remainder of its range it is generally associated with black jack
post and black oaks. In our area this species is never found closely
associated with limestone, and reports of this species being found on
limestone areas should be referred to <i>Quercus Muhlenbergii</i>.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Wood similar and uses generally the same as white oak.
The tree usually grows in such poor situations that it never acquires
a large diameter, and it is only when a tree is found in a cove or in richer
and deeper soil that it grows to a large size. The amount of this species
is very limited and it is therefore of no especial economic importance as
a source of timber supply. The bark is rich in tannin. The crests of
chestnut oak ridges are often cut bare of this species. The trunks are
made into crossties, and the larger branches are peeled for their bark.
The nuts germinate on top of the ground as soon as they fall, or even
before they fall. Usually a large percentage germinate. The tree
grows rapidly where soil conditions are at all favorable. It is believed
that this species should be used to reforest the chestnut oak ridges of
the State, and possibly it would be one of the best to employ on the
slopes of other poor ridges.</p>

middle of the leaf which cut off a large roughly triangular portion, one
angle of which forms the base, the top two angles prolonged on each
side into a rounded lobe which may be long or short; the terminal lobe is
produced by two deep sinuses which constrict the blade at about
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> its length from the apex; the two basal and two terminal
sinuses form the two lateral lobes which in size are equal to about one
half of the leaf area; the lateral lobes are generally ascending with the
terminal portion usually indented with a shallow sinus which produces
two short lobes; the terminal lobe of the leaf commonly has two or
three shallow secondary lobes; all the lobes of the leaf are rounded; base
of leaf narrowed or rounded; leaves very thick at maturity, when they
first appear both surfaces are densely covered with a yellowish pubescence,
at maturity the upper surface is a dark glossy green, and smooth
or nearly so, except some leaves retain fascicles of hairs, and the midrib
and principal veins may be more or less rough pubescent, the under
surface at maturity is a gray-green, and remains more or less densely
covered with fascicles of hairs; acorns single or in clusters, sessile or
nearly so; nuts small, ovoid 10-15 mm. long and 6-10 mm. wide, inclosed
for about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> their length in the cup; scales ovate, gray or reddish
brown, tomentose on the back, blunt except those near the top of the
cup which are sometimes acute; kernel sweet.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Massachusetts, Indiana, south to Florida, and west
to Oklahoma and Texas. In Indiana it is confined to the southwestern
part of the State. In our area it is found on the crest of ridges in the
knob area where it is generally associated with black, and black jack
oaks, hence in our poorest and thinnest soils. West of the knob area
it takes up different habitats. From Vigo County southward it is
found on sand ridges associated with black and black jack oaks. West
of the knob area it is frequently found in black oak woods and in Warrick
County about two miles southwest of Tennyson it is a frequent
tree in the Little Pigeon Creek bottoms which are a hard light clay
soil. Here it is associated with pin oak and cork elm (<i>Ulmus alata</i>).
In the Lower Wabash Valley, especially in Point Township of Posey
County in the hard clay of this area it is a frequent to a common tree,
associated with Spanish, pin, swamp, white and shingle oaks, and
sweet gum. In this area it grows to be a large tree.</p>

<p>This species has been reported for Hamilton County by Wilson, but
I regard this reference a wrong identification which will relieve Hamilton
County of the reputation of having "post oak" land. It was reported,
also, by Gorby for Miami County. Since Gorby's list is wholly unreliable,
it is best to drop this reference. Higley and Raddin<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> reported
a single tree near Whiting. Nieuwland<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> reported this species from near
Mineral Springs in Porter County, the report being based on his number
10,207 which I have not seen. There is no reason to doubt these
references, because it is not an unusual thing to find a southern form
jump from southern Indiana to a congenial habitat about Lake Michigan.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Wood is similar but tougher than white oak, and its uses
are the same as white oak. Since in our area the tree is usually medium
sized, most of the trees are worked up into crossties. A tree in
a black oak woods 4 miles east of Washington in Daviess County
measured 2.22 meters (87<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches) in circumference breast high.
This species in some localities is called iron oak, and in Gibson County
on the sand dune area it is called sand bur oak.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Nova Scotia to Manitoba, south to Georgia and
west to Texas and Wyoming. Found in all parts of Indiana, although
we have no reports from the knob area where no doubt it is only local.
It is a tree of wet woods, low borders of streams, etc., except among the
hills of southern Indiana, it is an occasional tree of the slopes. In
favorable habitats it was a frequent to a common tree. Its most
constant associates are white elm, swamp white and red oak, linn,
green and black ash, shellbark hickory, etc. It is sometimes called
mossy-cup oak.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Wood and uses similar to that of white oak. In point
of number, size and value it ranks as one of the most valuable trees of
the State. Michaux<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> says: "A tree three miles from Troy, Ohio, was

west to Texas. In Indiana it is found only about river sloughs or deep
swamps in the southwestern counties. At present it is known only
from Knox, Gibson, Posey and Spencer Counties. It was reported by
Nieuwland<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> for Marshall County on the authority of Clark. This
specimen was taken during a survey of Lake Maxinkuckee, and is
deposited in the National Museum. I have had the specimen examined
by an authority, who reports that it is some other species. Its habitat
is that of areas that are inundated much of the winter season. It is so
rare that its associates could not be learned. In one place it grew in a
depression lower than a nearby pin oak, and in another place it grew in
a depression in a very low woods, surrounded by sweet gum, big shell
bark hickory, and pin oak. It is generally found singly in depressions,
but it is a common tree on the low border of the west side of Burnett's
pond in Gibson County.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Pennsylvania, Michigan to Nebraska, south to
Georgia and west to Arkansas. Found throughout Indiana. It is essentially
a tree of low ground, but it is sometimes found near the base
of slopes, and in the knob area it is sometimes found on the crest of
ridges. In all parts of Indiana except the southwestern part it is found
only locally and then usually in colonies of a few trees. In Wells County,
I know of only two trees located at the base of a slope bordering a pond
in Jackson Township. In the southwestern part of the State it is
frequent to a common tree in its peculiar habitat. It appears that when
drainage basins decrease in size, and leave sandy river bottoms, and
bordering low sand dunes, that the shingle oak is the first oak to occupy
the area. On the sand ridges it is crowded out by the black, black jack
and post oaks. In the bottoms it is succeeded by pin, Schneck's, Spanish,
swamp white and post oaks. Special notes were made on its distribution
on a trip through Gibson, Pike, Daviess, Greene and Sullivan
Counties, going from Francisco northward through the Patoka bottoms
where in many places it forms pure stands. Usually in situations
a little higher than the pin oak zone. Thence eastward to Winslow
and then north to Sandy Hook in Daviess County, thence north to
Washington, Montgomery, Odon, Newberry, Lyons, Marco and Sullivan.
In its habitat all along this route it was a frequent to a very
common tree. A few miles northeast of Montgomery is a small area
which a pioneer informed me was originally a prairie. Typical prairie
plants are yet found along the roadside and fences in the area. I was
informed that the shingle oak was the only species found on the area,
and on the border of the area. It is believed the mass distribution of
the species was in the area indicated by the preceding route. Both east
and west of this area the species becomes less frequent.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Wood similar to red oak, but much inferior. Evidently
it is rather a slow growing tree, but it might find a use as a shade or
ornamental tree in sandy habitats where the pin oak would not thrive.
It is also called black oak, peach oak, jack oak and water oak.</p>

on the edges; twigs soon smooth and reddish; leaves on petioles
2.5-5 cm. long, 10-20 cm. long, oval to oblong-obovate, broadly wedge-shape
or truncate at the base, the margins divided by wide or narrow
sinuses generally into 7-9 lobes, sometimes as many as 11, the lobes not
uniform in size or shape, lobes broadest at the base and ending generally
in 1-5 bristle points, pubescent above and below at first, soon becoming
smooth at maturity and a dark green above, paler and yellowish-green
beneath and smooth or with tufts of tomentum in the axils of the veins;
acorns solitary or in pairs, sessile or on very short stalks; nuts ovoid,
flat at the base, and rounded at the apex, 2-3 cm. long, enclosed for
about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> their length in the shallow cup; cups 2-3 cm. in diameter,
thick, saucer-shape, flat or only slightly rounded at the base; scales
ovate, blunt, appressed, and pubescent on the back; kernel somewhat
bitter, eaten by hogs and cattle, but not relished by wild animals.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Nova Scotia to Minnesota, south to Florida and
west to Texas. Found throughout Indiana, although local in the knob
area. Its preferred habitat is that of moist, rich and fairly well drained
woods. It does not thrive in situations that are inundated much of the
winter season such as the pin oak will endure. In the southern part of
the State, especially in the flats it is frequently found on the high bluffs
of streams and very large forest trees are frequent on a dry wooded
slope of ten acres, on the Davis farm four miles south of Salem. In a
congenial habitat it was a frequent to a common tree, although such a
thing as nearly a pure stand would never be met with, such as was often
formed by the white, black, shingle or pin oak.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Wood hard, heavy, strong, close-grained, but not as
good as white oak in any of its mechanical qualities. Commercially
all of the biennial oaks are usually considered as red oak. The true red
oak, however, is generally considered the best of all the biennial oaks.
Until recently, when white oak became scarce, red oak was not in much
demand, and was used principally for construction material. Now it is
substituted in many places for white oak, and the uses now are in a
great measure the same as those of white oak.</p>

<p>The red oak grows rapidly, and is able to adapt itself to many soil
conditions. It has been used in European countries for two centuries
for shade and ornamental planting. It reproduces easily by planting
the acorns, and should receive attention by woodlot owners as a suitable
species for reinforcing woodlands, or in general forest planting.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Massachusetts, southwestern Ontario, Michigan to
Iowa and south to Virginia and west to Oklahoma. Found in every
county of Indiana. It is found only in wet situations where it is a
frequent to a common tree. It prefers a hard compact clay soil with
little drainage hence is rarely met with on the low borders of lakes
where the soil is principally organic matter.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Wood similar to red oak, but much inferior to it. It is
tardy in the natural pruning of its lower branches, and when the dead
branches break off they usually do so at some distance from the trunk.
The stumps of the dead branches which penetrate to the center of the
tree have given it the name of pin oak. It is also sometimes called
water oak, and swamp oak.</p>

<p>For street and ornamental planting it is one of the most desirable
oaks to use. It is adapted to a moist soil, grows rapidly, and produces
a dense shade. When grown in the open it develops a pyramidal crown.</p>

<p>The nut of this species always has a depressed form, except a tree or
two in Wells County which produce ovate nuts which are cone-pointed,
and in bulk about half the size of the ordinary form. This form should
be looked for to ascertain its area of distribution.</p>

generally pubescent on the back, gray or with a reddish tip on those of

red of trees of the Upper Wabash Valley.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;In Indiana this species has been reported only from
Wells, Bartholomew, Vermillion, Knox, Gibson and Posey Counties.
This species was not separated from our common red oak until after all
of the local floras of Indiana had been written, and it may have a much
wider range than is at present known. In Wells County it is the prevailing
"red oak" of the county, and no doubt is distributed throughout
the Wabash Valley. In this area it is associated with all moist
ground species. In the lower Wabash Valley, especially in Gibson,
Knox and Posey Counties it is associated with Spanish, pin, and shingle
oaks, sweet gum, etc. Several trees were noted in Knox County in
Little Cypress swamp where it was associated with cypress, pin oak,
white elm, red maple and swell-butt ash.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This anomalous red oak has a range from Indiana to
Texas. When the attention of authors was directed to it, several new
species were the result. Later authors are not agreed as to whether
this form, which has such a wide range and hence liable to show considerable
variation within such a long range, is one or several species.
C. S. Sargent who for years has studied this form throughout its range
has seen the author's specimens and calls those with shallow cups
typical or nearly typical <i>Quercus Shumardii</i> Buckley<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and those with the
deep cups <i>Quercus Shumardii</i> variety <i>Schneckii</i> (Britton) Sargent.</p>

<p>The writer has made rather an intensive study of the forms in Wells
County and in the Lower Wabash Valley and has not been able to satisfy
himself that, allowing for a reasonable variation, there is even a
varietal difference in Indiana forms. The description has been drawn
to cover all of the forms of Indiana.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. J. Schneck of Mt. Carmel, Illinois, was one of the first to discover
that this form was not our common red oak, and when he called
Dr. Britton's attention to it, Dr. Britton named it <i>Quercus Schneckii</i> in
honor of its discoverer.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Northwestern Indiana to Manitoba and south to
Iowa. In Indiana it has been reported only from Lake and Porter
Counties by Hill, and from White County by Heimlich. According to
Hill, who has made the most extensive study of the distribution of this
species in our area, the tree is found on sandy and clayey uplands, and
in moist sandy places. It closely resembles the pin oak for which it has
been mistaken. It also resembles the black and scarlet oaks. We have
very little data on the range or distribution of the species in this State.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Maine, southern Ontario, southern Minnesota,
southern Nebraska south to Florida and west to Texas. Found
throughout Indiana. It was no doubt found in every county or nearly
every county of the State. It of course would be a rare tree throughout
the rich black loam soils of the central Indiana counties. The black oak
is confined to the poorer soils of the State, such as clay and gravelly
ridges, sand dunes, sand ridges, and the hills of southern Indiana that
are not covered with beech or white oak. It is a frequent to a common
tree in the southwestern part of the State in the bottom lands where it
is associated with Schneck's, shingle, and post oaks. In the northern
part of the State it is generally associated with the white oak and if the
soil is very poor it will form almost pure stands. On the poor ridges of
southern Indiana it is generally associated with the white, and scarlet
oaks, and invades habitats still poorer which are occupied by post,
black jack, or chestnut oaks. Wherever the black oak is found it is
generally more than a frequent tree and is usually a common tree or
forms the principal stand. While the black is not so uniformly distributed
over the State as the white oak, yet in point of numbers it nearly
equals it, or may even exceed it.</p>

<p>In Floyd and Harrison Counties are certain small areas which were
known to the early settlers as the "barrens." These areas were treeless.
They were covered with a growth of some sort of oak which the natives
call "scrub" oak, hazel, and wild plum. The height of the growth in
any part would "not hide a man on horse back." These areas are now
all under cultivation, and are no longer distinguished from the forested
areas. However, many parts of the barrens are now covered with
forests, but these forests are a complete stand of black oak. Last year
one of these areas was cut off, and the age of the trees were ascertained
to be about 65 years old. The barrens of southern Indiana and adjacent
States offer a good problem for ecologists.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Wood similar to that of red oak, but often much inferior.
The uses of the best grades of black oak are practically the same
as red oak.</p>

<p>Where the black and scarlet oaks are associated, the scarlet oak is
rarely separated from it. The two species superficially much resemble
each other. The black oak is always easily distinguished by cutting into
the inner bark which is yellow, while that of scarlet oak is gray or
reddish. The inner bark imparts a yellow color to spittle, and the scarlet
does not. When mature fruiting branches are at hand they may be
separated by the appearance of the acorns. The scales of the cups of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
black oak are dull, and loosely imbricated near the top while those of the
scarlet oak are rather glossy and closely imbricated. The scales of the
scarlet oak, however, become somewhat loose after the acorn has
matured, and fallen for some time.</p>

<p>This species is sometimes called yellow oak. Since the chinquapin
oak is also often called yellow oak, it is best to always call this species
black oak.</p>

Medium sized trees with bark resembling the black oak, inner bark
gray or reddish; twigs reddish by autumn; winter buds reddish-brown
and pubescent; leaves on petioles 2.5-6 cm. long, broadly oval to obovate,
blades 7-15 cm. long, truncate or wedge-shape at the base, the
blade divided into 5-7 lobes by deep and wide sinuses which cut the
blade more than half the distance to the midrib, sinuses rounded at the
base, the lobes variable in size and shape, usually the lowest are the
shortest and smallest, the middle lobes the largest and longest, the
lobes widest either at the base or the apex, the terminal part toothed
or lobed, the terminal lobe generally 3-lobed or 3-toothed, both surfaces
of the leaves at first pubescent, soon smooth and a dark glossy green
above, and paler and smooth beneath except tufts of hairs in the axils of
the principal veins; acorns sessile or nearly so, solitary or in pairs; nuts
ovoid to oblong, 1.5-2 cm. long, enclosed for about half their length in
the thick cup-shape cup; scales triangular but blunt, closely appressed,
pubescent on the back except the center which is generally elevated
and smooth and shiny, giving the cup a glossy appearance which easily
separates it from its nearest ally the black oak whose cup is a dull, ash
or reddish gray color; kernel white within, and less bitter than the black
oak.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Maine, southern Ontario to southern Nebraska, south
to North Carolina, Alabama and Arkansas. It has been reported for the
northwest counties and the southern part of Indiana, but we have no
records for the east-central portion of the State. Clark reports it as
common about Winona Lake, but does not report <i>Quercus velutina</i>
which is a common tree of the vicinity, and it is believed that Clark
has confused the two species. In the northern part of the State its
habitat is that of sand and gravel ridges associated with black oak.
In the hill part of southern Indiana it is intimately associated with the
black oak on the poorer ridges. We have no authentic records for the
southwestern counties. The author has Schneck's specimens on which
the record for Gibson and Posey County was based. I determined the
specimens as belonging to the Spanish oak, and William Trelease
verified the determination. I have no doubt that scarlet oak occurred
on the sand ridges of that area.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;New Jersey and Missouri, south to Florida and west
to Texas. The known distribution in Indiana would be that part of the
State south of a line drawn from Vincennes to North Madison. It is
local except in the southwestern counties. In our area it is found on
both high and low ground. In Jefferson and Clark Counties it is found
only in the flats where it is associated with beech, sweet gum, pin oak,
red maple and black gum. A colony was found in Washington County
on high ground, about eight miles southwest of Salem associated with
black and post oak. In Harrison County about two miles southeast
of Corydon it was found on the crest of a ridge with white and black
oak. In Daviess County about four miles east of Washington it is
associated with black and post oak. In Knox, Gibson, Pike and Warrick
Counties it is local on sand ridges with black oak. It occurs in the
greatest abundance in the river bottoms of Gibson, Posey and Spencer
Counties, where it is generally associated with pin, Schneck's, shingle,
swamp white, black and post oaks, and sweet gum. In the last named
counties it is fairly well distributed, and is a frequent to a common
tree. Brown's<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> report for Fountain County should not be recognized
without a verifying specimen, since his list was compiled from a list

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Wood and uses similar to that of red oak. In Indiana
it is all sold as red oak. In all parts of its range in Indiana it is known as
red or black oak. However, the best accepted common name of this
species throughout its range is Spanish oak, and since no other species
is known by this name, it should be used for this species.</p>

<p>The bark of this species varies considerably in color and tightness.
The leaves are exceedingly variable in form. The leaves on the same
tree will vary from 3-lobed to 11-lobed. Usually the lobing is deepest
in the leaves nearest the top of the tree. Leaves of small trees, coppice
shoots, and of the lower branches of some trees are often all or for the
greater part 3-lobed. The color of the pubescence of the lower surface
of the leaves varies from a gray to a yellow-gray. The variations have
lead authors to divide this polymorphic species into several species and
varieties. The author has included all the forms that occur in Indiana
under one name.</p>

<p>This species is variously known as <i>Quercus digitata</i>, <i>Quercus triloba</i>,
<i>Quercus pagodaefolia</i>, and by the most recent authors as <i>Quercus pagoda</i>
and <i>Quercus rubra</i> and its varieties. Specimens in the author's collection
from Jefferson County were reported by Sargent<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> as <i>Quercus

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;New York to Nebraska, south to Florida and west
to Texas. In Indiana it is known to the author from Sullivan, Greene
and Clark Counties and southwestward. It has been reported from
Jefferson County by Barnes which is no doubt correct. Doubtful
records are those by Brown for Fountain County, Miami County by
Gorby, and Phinney's report for the area of Delaware, Jay, Randolph
and Wayne Counties. It has been reported for the vicinity of Chicago
by Higley and Raddin. It may be local on sterile, sandy ridges of
the northern part of the State, but very local if it does occur. It is
generally found in very poor soil on the crest of ridges associated
with black and post oak. However, it has been found in Greene,
Sullivan and Knox counties on sand ridges and at the base of sand
ridges associated with black and post oak. The species has a very
limited mass distribution and is only occasionally found and in colonies
of a few trees each.</p>

Fairly large trees with deeply fissured reddish-brown bark without
white streaks between the layers of the ridges, twigs very pubescent
and green at first, becoming gray or reddish-brown at the end of the
season and remaining more or less pubescent for a year or more; buds
ovate, a very dark reddish brown, the scales more or less pubescent;
leaves ovate, oval or slightly obovate, average blades 8-15 cm. long,
hairy on both surfaces at first, remaining more or less pubescent beneath
until maturity, and becoming very rough above with a few scattered
hairs remaining, fragrant when dried, fragrance remaining for years;
fruit ripening the last of April or the first of May before or with the unfolding

wide or wider than the seed, margin glabrous, seed densely pubescent
on both sides; wood hard, strong, light when well seasoned and not
warping as badly as white elm.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Quebec south to Florida, west to Texas, Nebraska
and North Dakota. Found in all parts of Indiana. In the prairies or in
the "flats" it may be absent in one or more contiguous counties and
may be entirely absent on the crests and upper slopes of ridges. It
prefers a moist well drained soil, and where it is found it is usually
a frequent to a common tree, although rarely is it found as a very
common tree. It is usually associated with sugar maple, beech, white
ash, linn, tulip, white oak, etc.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This tree usually is from 3-6 dm. in diameter and tall
for its diameter. However, larger trees occur. In the Ind. Geol.
Rept. 6:70:1875 mention is made of a tree in Jackson County that was
"18 feet in circumference." The uses of the wood are similar to that
of white elm. The inner bark collected in spring is much used in
medicine under the name of slippery elm.</p>

becoming glabrous by the end of the season; buds ovate, acute and
glabrous; leaves ovate, oval or obovate, average blades 8-12 cm. long,

before or as the leaves unfold, generally oval in shape, about 1 cm.
long, both surfaces glabrous, margins about as wide as the seed and
fringed with hairs; wood hard, tough, flexible, generally hard to split,
warps badly in seasoning.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Quebec to Florida, west to Texas and Nebraska.
Found throughout Indiana, and doubtless in every county. It is frequent
to common or very common on the flood plains of streams, in
wet woods and in low ground generally.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This species is also called water elm, swamp elm, gray
elm, bitter elm, sour elm and in southwestern counties it is often called
red elm. In Perry County it is often called hub elm. It is generally
known as "elm" and when this term is used, it refers to this species.
The wood has a very wide range of uses. The greatest amount has been
used for hoops, staves and heading. Large quantities have been used
in the manufacture of agricultural implements, hubs, furniture,
basket handles, etc. White elm is usually considered very difficult
to split, but I was informed by a pioneer timber cutter that the heart
wood of the veterans of the forest splits as well as oak, and that he
worked many a tree up into staves. He told me that he made into
staves a tree in Paulding County, Ohio, that was eight feet in diameter
at the stump. There is little attempt being made by woodlot owners to
propagate this tree. However, the natural propagation of the species is
probably greater than any other species because it produces seed at an
early age, and culls of the forest are not cut because they are not
good for fuel which leaves them to produce seed. Then the seed are
light, and are scattered to great distances by the wind and water. It
is propagated very easily from seedlings.</p>

<p>The tree when grown in the open has a tendency to be bushy and
unless it is given some pruning will have a very short clear trunk.
It has always been regarded as one of the best species for shade tree
planting. For beauty of form it is not excelled by any tree for shade
or ornamental planting. However, it has several insect enemies that
require spraying to keep them under control.</p>

Large trees; bark deeply fissured and grayish like the bark of the
white elm; twigs light brown, generally densely hairy and remaining
more or less pubescent until the end of the season or later, the twigs
of some specimens are glabrous or only slightly hairy at first and soon
become glabrous and somewhat glaucous, after the first year some of the
branchlets begin to develop 1-4 corky ridges from a few millimeters to
5 or 6 mm. in thickness, the ridges are wide and rounded at the top,
dark gray, brown and discontinuous, rarely a corky ridge will appear on
a branchlet the first year; leaves oval or obovate, average blades
8-15 cm. long, at maturity glabrous and smooth or rough to very rough
above, permanently pubescent beneath especially on the veins; fruit
ripens late in May or early in June when the leaves are from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>
grown; samara oval, usually 1.5-2 cm. long, oblique at the base, with a
beak 2-5 mm. long at the apex, both faces pubescent, wing about as wide
as the seed; wood hard heavy, strong, flexible, uses the same as white
elm.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Southern Quebec and Ontario south to northern
New Jersey and west to Minnesota and Missouri. The distribution in
Indiana has not been studied. The frequency of its occurrence is not
known, and all of the known stations are given. The published records
are as follows: Dearborn (Collins); Franklin (Meyncke); Hamilton
(Wilson); Jefferson (Barnes) and (Deam); Noble (VanGorder); Parke
(Hobbs); St. Joseph (Nieuwland); Steuben (Bradner); Wayne (Petry
and Markle); Wells (Deam). Additional records are Hendricks, Noble,
Ripley, Vermillion and Wayne by Deam. The published record for
Posey County by Deam and Schneck should be referred to <i>Ulmus
alata</i>. It prefers a well drained soil and is most frequently found near
the base of the slope or on the top of flood plain banks of streams, in
ravines, or in a habitat like a beech-sugar maple woods. It is reported
to have been frequent in Franklin, Noble and Wells Counties.</p>

<p>Its appearance and habit of growth is so much like the white elm
that it is not commonly distinguished from it, which accounts for the
lack of definite knowledge of its range in our area.</p>

gradually becoming a gray-brown; branchlets usually begin to develop
two thin narrow corky ridges, becoming by the end of the second
year 4-7 mm. thick, the year's growth of corky layer a light brown,
the older layers a darker brown, the two main corky ridges are on opposite

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Virginia west through southern Indiana to southern
Missouri, south to the Gulf and west to Texas. In Indiana it is confined
to the southwestern part of the State. Gorby's report for Miami
should be ignored. It has been reported as far north as Vigo and
Monroe Counties by Blatchley, and as far east as Clark County by
Baird and Taylor. The author has collected it in Crawford, Dubois,
Martin, Orange, Perry, Posey, Spencer and Warrick Counties.</p>

<p>The tree has two rather distinct habitats. In the hill counties it
is found on the sides of cliffs, steep slopes or on the top of the ridges
with such species as the black, chestnut and scarlet oaks and chestnut.
In this habitat it is usually a small scrubby tree with an
excessive number of side branches. Such specimens usually have the
corky ridges well developed on all of the branches and the tree presents a
weird appearance. The second habitat is in the hard clay flats of the
southwestern counties. In Warrick County along Big Pigeon Creek
west of Boonville I measured a specimen 21 dm. in circumference and I
estimated the clear bole at 8 m. It was associated with sweet gum, black
gum, white elm, red birch, red oak, etc. It is found throughout this
county both in the "flats" and on the sandy ridges. In Posey County it
is a frequent tree in the low woods about 10 miles southwest of Mt.
Vernon. In these woods it acquires a diameter of 3-6 dm. and is associated
with post oak, Spanish oak, sweet gum, shingle oak, etc. It is
to be noted that specimens that grow in these conditions and those that
acquire a large size do not develop such conspicuous corky branches.
A large tree over 6 dm. in diameter was noted in the eastern part of
Gibson County growing in low sandy soil which was destitute of corky
branches so far as could be seen from the ground. All of the branches
examined were free from corky ridges, and only a few corky excrescences
were present. The specimen could easily be identified by the leaves.
Another large tree 12 dm. in circumference in a black oak woods 4 miles
south of Marengo in Crawford County was also free from corky ridges.</p>

<p>This is an interesting tree and requires further study to establish its
range in Indiana and to learn its habits. In Jasper, Indiana, it is a
frequent shade tree. No doubt the trees were obtained from a nearby
woods along the Patoka River where this species is known to occur.</p>

<p class="caption2nb"><a name="CELTIS" id="CELTIS"></a><b>2. CÉLTIS.</b> <span class="smcap">The Hackberries.</span></p>

<p>Trees with pith of branchlets chambered; flowers in Indiana species
appear before the leaves, the leaves generally with 3 primary veins at the
base; staminate flowers usually in clusters, the pistillate solitary or
few together in the axils of the leaves, and near the end of the twigs;
fruit a globose drupe, sometimes elongated, pulp thin and sweet, frequently
remaining on the tree until late winter, relished by birds; stone
bony, wrinkled.</p>

<p>Some of the American species of hackberry are very variable. The
habitat of the species varies from deep swamps to arid rocky slopes. In
fact, a single species as now understood may have a variable habitat.
The following variations may be noted on the same tree or on different
trees of the same species. The twigs may be glabrous, or pubescent;
the leaves may vary in size, shape and texture, leaf margin, and in the
roughness or smoothness of the surfaces; the petioles may be smooth
or hairy; the pedicels may be glabrous or pubescent, shorter or longer
than the petioles; the fruit also varies in shape. Leaves have been seen
on the same tree which were smooth above, while others were quite
rough above, the difference being due to the exposure to light.</p>

<p>The original descriptions of the species are too short to sufficiently
characterize the species, which adds to the confusion. However, C. S.
Sargent<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> has recently revised the species and varieties of our area.</p>

<p>Prof. Sargent has examined and named all of my material for me.
Mr. B. F. Bush, who has extensively studied the hackberries in the
field, also has examined my specimens.</p>

<p>The writer has paid special attention to the hackberries of the State
for the past few years and is still in doubt as to the status of the species
that occur in the State. Since I am not following the determinations
made by Sargent and Bush, and am following the nomenclature of the
first edition, I regard the present treatment as tentative only.</p>

some of the surface warty and rough; twigs smooth or pubescent,
the fruiting ones generally smooth; leaves of an ovate type on petioles
0.5-2 cm. long, the blades of fruiting twigs 5-15 cm. long, those of vegetative
twigs sometimes larger, oblique or slightly cordate at base,
gradually tapering to a point at apex, or long acuminate at the apex,
often becoming thick at maturity, especially those exposed to full sunlight,
generally smooth above at maturity, especially those of fruiting
twigs, or sometimes rough, especially those of vegetative branchlets or
those growing in the shade, the under surface more or less pubescent
along the veins at maturity; fruit matures in late autumn, very dark red,
sometimes appearing almost black, globose or somewhat oblong, generally
about 9-10 mm. in diameter, borne on pedicels which are longer or up
to twice as long as the petioles; the pedicels which are always ascending
are straight or somewhat curved upwards; nutlets globose, a little longer
than wide.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Valley of the St. Lawrence River, southern Ontario,
to North Dakota, and south to the Gulf States and west to Texas.
More or less frequent along streams throughout the State, except in the
hilly counties of the southern part of the State. It is always found in
moist soil, except in the hilly counties where it may be found on wooded
slopes or on high rocky bluffs bordering streams. In all of our area the
species is practically confined to drainage basins, and is generally close
to streams.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;The wood is yellowish-white and before seasoning very
much resembles ash for which it was generally sold. It has good bending
qualities and is now much sought after for hoops. It was formerly
often known as hoop ash. The supply is now becoming scarce, but
when bought sells for the same price as good white elm.</p>

<p>Some writers include under the name <i>Celtis occidentalis</i> only those
forms which are small trees and have ovate, short-pointed leaves. This
type of tree has not been found in Indiana. The form with long
acuminate pointed leave which is the common form in our area, is
regarded as a variety of <i>Celtis occidentalis</i>. Trees having the upper
surface of the leaves very rough are called <i>Celtis crassifolia</i> Lamarck,
or are merely regarded as a variety of <i>Celtis occidentalis</i>. This form
is found throughout our area.</p>

<p>The hackberry is sometimes used as a shade tree. It can scarcely be
recommended because its leaves and twigs are often affected by galls
which detract from its appearance.</p>

Plate 62. Bark thin, smooth and gray on shrub-like forms, warty
or deeply fissured on the larger forms; ridges flat and broken, dark gray-brown;
twigs at first hairy, becoming smooth or nearly so by autumn;
leaves of an ovate type, broadly-ovate, oblong-ovate to narrow ovate,
on petioles 0.5-1.5 cm. long, blades of fruiting branchlets 3-10 cm. long,
those of sterile twigs sometimes larger, oblique, rounded or somewhat
cordate at the base, taper-pointed, sometimes acuminate at the apex,
margins entire or with a few teeth usually about or above the middle,
becoming thick and smooth above at maturity, sometimes rough,
especially on vigorous shoots, generally somewhat pubescent along the
veins beneath; fruit matures late in the autumn, usually an orange or
light cherry color late in summer, becoming a very dark cherry color
late in the autumn, globose to ellipsoidal, on pedicels about as long as
the petioles; sometimes the pedicels are shorter but usually about one-half
longer; pedicels generally ascending, rarely recurved, when recurved
the pedicels are short.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Pennsylvania to northern Illinois, south to Florida
and west to Arkansas. Local in Indiana. It has been collected by the
writer in Lake County near the mouth of the Grand Calumet River
where it was collected by E. J. Hill who has given us the most detailed
account of this species.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Also collected on a high, gravelly hill on the
east side of Hog-back Lake, Steuben County; on a rocky wooded slope
in Hamar's Hollow southeast of Mitchell in Lawrence County; on a
"knob" in Floyd County; on a rocky wooded slope near Big Spring
in Washington County; frequent on a rocky wooded slope near the
Ohio River east of Elizabeth in Harrison County; on the bank of Blue
River near Milltown in Crawford County; and in Perry County
along the bluffs of the Ohio River about six miles east of Cannelton,
and also on the crest of a ridge about six miles southwest of Derby.
It has also been reported by Nieuwland for Clark in Marshall County.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This species is usually a small shrub, and usually bears
fruit when only 1.5-2 meters (5 or 6 feet) tall. Only a few trees have
been seen that were 40 cm. (4 inches) in diameter. The small size at
which this species fruits, easily distinguishes it from other species in
our area. Its habitat also serves to distinguish it. Along Lake Michigan
it grows on the dry sand dunes, and in southern Indiana it grows on
dry rocky slopes.</p>

<p>Sargent who has examined all of my specimens credits Indiana with
the typical species, and separates from it a form which he calls <i>Celtis
pumila</i> variety <i>Deamii</i><a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. This variety is based upon my <span class="smcap">No</span>. 18,727,
and the type specimen has been photographed to illustrate this species.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
The writer is not able to separate the two forms in our area, and believes
that all belong either to <i>Celtis pumila</i> or to the new variety.</p>

<span class="smcap">Sugarberry. Hackberry.</span> <a href="#Plate_63">Plate 63.</a> Medium sized trees with the
bark of the trunk of large trees irregularly covered with wart-like
excrescences, rarely somewhat irregularly fissured, bark of the upper
part of trunk and larger branches resembling that of the beech; leaves
of an ovate-lanceolate type, as a whole narrower than the preceding
species; on petioles 5-12 mm. long, blades of fruiting twigs 4-8 cm. long,
usually rounded at the base, sometimes oblique, slightly cordate or
somewhat narrowed at the base, usually gradually long-taper pointed
at apex, margins generally entire, rarely a few teeth toward the apex,
green on both surfaces, generally mature leaves are smooth above and
below, more rarely somewhat rough above, and with some pubescence
along the veins beneath; fruit in late summer an orange red color,
gradually becoming darker until late autumn when it becomes red;
pedicels shorter or longer than the petioles, usually slightly longer and
ascending, fruit nearly globose, a trifle smaller than the preceding, and
about two-thirds as large as the first.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Virginia, southern Indiana, Missouri, eastern Kansas,
south to the Gulf States and west to Texas. In Indiana it is confined
to the southwestern counties. It is now known to definitely occur
in Sullivan, Gibson, Posey, Warrick and Spencer Counties. Two trees
were noted also, in the Muscatatuck bottoms near Delany Creek in
Washington County. A "single bush about eight feet high" was reported
from Jefferson County by Young. This may have been the
preceding species. It was also reported by Haymond from Franklin
County.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;With one exception all the specimens of this species have
been found in very low ground. Usually it is associated with such low
ground species as pecan, sweet gum, swell-butt ash, and the cane.
One very peculiar specimen was found on the crest of a ridge about
seven miles north of Salem in Washington County. It was a tree about
fifteen feet tall, and had very narrow entire leaves.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Southern Ontario west to eastern Dakotas, south
to the Gulf States and west to Texas. Found throughout Indiana,
although there are no records for the extreme northwestern counties.
Throughout our area it must be regarded as infrequent. It is only here
and there that you find a tree, and I have never seen it where there were
even a small number of trees close together. In the northern part of
the State it is usually found in a moist well drained soil, associated
with trees such as beech and sugar maple, or in lower ground with
slippery elm and linn. It has no particular affinity for streams. In the
southern part of the State it is found in both rich and poor soils. However,
it is most often met with near the base of slopes.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This tree seldom has a clear bole of more than 3-5 m. and
is usually a tree about 20 cm. in diameter, rarely as large as 6 dm. in
diameter, although there is a record<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> of a tree in Georgia that was "7
feet in diameter at 3 feet above the ground."</p>

<p>The wood has been a favorite for fence posts since pioneer times. It
transplants easily. The fruit is a favorite with birds and for this reason
it should be planted about orchards and in woodlots. It is sometimes

long taper-pointed at the apex, margins entire, pubescent on both
sides while young, becoming at maturity lustrous and glabrous above,
remaining pubescent beneath; fruit globose, about 1 dm. in diameter;
wood heavy, very hard and strong, the most durable in contact with the
soil of any of our post timbers.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Missouri and Kansas south to Texas. Introduced
into Indiana for hedge fences. There is some question as to the ability
of this species to escape. I have heard that it frequently sends up root
shoots at several feet from hedge fences, and that it frequently seeds
itself along old hedge fences. For the past few years I have given the
species especial attention and I have never seen it as an escape except
in three instances.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This species was formerly much planted for farm
fences, but since land has become so valuable, its use has been discontinued,
and the old fences are being dug up. The tree grows a short
trunk, and one was noted in Grant County that was at least 6 dm. in
diameter that was estimated to be less than fifty years old. This
species is subject to the San Jose scale and in some localities it has been
killed by it. It has been but little used for forest planting, and the
plantations are not yet old enough to measure their success.</p>

Large trees with furrowed bark which is gray and much resembles the
tulip tree except the ridges are shallower and closer; twigs downy at
first, becoming glabrous or nearly so and a light to a cherry brown by
the end of the season; leaves oval, average blades 15-22 cm. long, rounded
to truncate at the base, abruptly short-pointed, pubescent on both
sides at first, becoming glabrous above, and remaining pubescent beneath,
rarely entirely glabrous; flowers about 6 cm. long, bell-shaped,
pale yellowish-green; fruit cylindrical, 5-7 cm. long, 1-2 cm. diameter,
the large scarlet seeds begin to push out of their receptacle in September;
wood light, soft, not strong, close-grained and durable.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;North shore of Lake Erie, western New York,
eastern Ohio, southern Indiana, southern Illinois and along the Appalachian
Mountains to southern Alabama and west to Arkansas.
It doubtless occurred in all or nearly all of the counties in southern
Indiana south of a line drawn from Franklin to Knox Counties. It no
doubt was extremely local. For instance a pioneer 81 years old who
had always lived in Washington County told me that there were two
trees on his farm near Pekin, and these were the only two trees he knew
of in the vicinity. These trees were popular because the neighbors
came for the fruit to put into whisky for making bitters which were a
specific for all ailments. I have seen only a shrub on the Forest Reserve
in Clark County. On a beech and sugar maple ridge about 4 miles
northwest of Medora in Jackson County on the Geo. W. Scott farm two
trees were still standing in 1915. Mr. Scott, a pioneer, said the species
was found on the ridge for about 2 miles and that there were about a
half dozen trees to the acre, and the largest was about a meter in diameter.
It is known in two other places in this county. A tree is still
standing in Lawrence County on the Sam Mitchell farm 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> miles
south of Bedford. Mr. Mitchell is a pioneer and says that a few trees
were found in the vicinity on the ridges. It has been reported for
Franklin, Floyd and Jefferson Counties. There is hearsay evidence
that it occurred in other counties.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;The cucumber tree has been too rare in Indiana to be of
economic importance. The greatest interest with us is its distribution.
The uses of the wood are similar to that of tulip with which it is botanically
related. It is said that the greater part of the lumber
which is produced in the south is sold as tulip. The seeds of this tree
are extremely bitter and no bird, squirrel or mouse will carry or touch
them. However, man after macerating them in whisky can use them
for medicine.</p>

<p><a name="Liriodendron_Tulipifera" id="Liriodendron_Tulipifera"></a><b>Liriodendron Tulipífera</b> Linnæus. Tulip. Yellow Poplar.
Plate 67. Large trees with deeply furrowed grayish bark; twigs glabrous and
glaucous at first, becoming reddish-brown by the end of the season, then
gray or dark brown; leaves very variable, 4-6 lobed, average blades 5-12
cm. long, truncate and notched at the apex, more or less rounded,
truncate or cordate at the base, glabrous above and below at maturity
or with a few hairs on the veins beneath; flowers appear in May or
June, large bell-shaped, about 4 cm. deep, greenish-yellow, sometimes
tinged with orange-red; fruit upright, cone-shaped, 5-7 cm. long;
wood light, weak, soft, stiff, straight and moderately coarse-grained,
seasons and works well. Sap wood white, heart wood a light yellow.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Vermont, southern Ontario, southern Michigan,
south to Florida and west to Arkansas and Missouri. Found throughout
Indiana, and doubtless is found in every county. It is rare to infrequent
in most of the counties north of the Wabash River. It gradually becomes
more frequent toward the south and where its habitat is found
it is frequent to common. It prefers a moist rich well drained soil and
thrives best in protected coves and near the lower part of slopes of hills.
It is found with beech, sugar maple and white oak. It is rarely found in
a black loam soil, but prefers a sandy soil. It was generally a common
tree and of very large size in practically all of the counties in the
southern two-thirds of the State.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This tree is generally known by botanists as tulip tree.
By lumbermen it is usually known as yellow poplar, or more often shortened
to poplar. It is also known as blue, white and hickory poplar, or
as white wood. The tulip tree is the second largest tree of Indiana.
In the Ind. Geol. Rept. 6:70:1875, is the following: "I measured four
poplar trees that stood within a few feet of each other; the largest was
thirty-eight feet in circumference three feet from the ground, one hundred
and twenty feet high, and about sixty-five feet to the first limb.
The others were, respectively eighteen and a half, eighteen and seventeen
feet in circumference at three feet from the ground." The range
of the uses of the wood is not so great as the oak, but it has many uses.
The demand has been so great that practically all of the large trees have
been cut. Small trees have so much sap or white wood that they are
not sought for lumber, but can be used for pulp and excelsior.</p>

<p>The tulip transplants easily, grows rapidly, tall and with short side
branches. Experiments in growing this tree indicate that it is one of
the very best trees for reinforcing the woodlot, and other forest planting.
It can be recommended for roadside planting because it grows tall and
has a deep root system. Where conditions of life are not too severe it
could be used for shade tree planting.</p>

Shrubs or small trees; bark smooth except on very old trees when it
becomes somewhat furrowed; twigs at first covered with rusty brown
hairs, becoming glabrous and reddish-brown by the end of the season;
leaves obovate-lanceolate, average blades 16-30 cm. long, abruptly
taper-pointed, wedge-shape at base, margins entire, somewhat rusty
pubescent at first, becoming at maturity glabrous above, and glabrous
or nearly so beneath; flowers appear in May or early June, maroon
color, drooping; fruit edible, ripening in September and October, 7-13
cm. long, greenish-yellow, smooth, pulp white or yellow, with a few
large, dark-brown flattened seeds; wood light, soft and weak.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;New York, north shore of Lake Erie, southern
Michigan, Nebraska, south to Florida and west to Texas. Found in all
parts of Indiana, although it is found in the greatest abundance in the
central counties. It prefers a moist rich soil, although it is quite
adaptive. Sometimes it is found in a black loam soil in low woods or
about lakes, but its preference is for a beech and sugar maple woods or
habitats approximating it. In the southern counties it is absent on the
sterile wooded ridges, but may be a common shrub at the base of the
slopes. It is a constant companion of the tulip tree and where one will
grow the other is likely to be found. It is a great tree to send up
suckers, hence it is always found in clumps, or forms real thickets.
This species with us is usually 2-7 meters high; however, there are
records of large trees. Collett in Ind. Geol. Rept. 5:404:1874, in a
geological report of Gibson County says: "A forest of pawpaw bushes
attracted our attention by their tree-like size, being nearly a foot in
diameter."</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This species is also known as the yellow and white pawpaw.
Recently some enthusiasts have christened it the "Hoosier
Banana". There has been an attempt for years to cultivate the pawpaw,
and some varieties have been named. The fruit is variable. The
one with a white pulp is rather insipid and is not considered good to eat.
The form with a yellow pulp is the kind that is regarded as the most palatable.
The two forms are not botanically separated but Prof. Stanley
Coulter has made some observations on the two forms in the Ind. Geol.
Rept. 24:745:1899. He says: "Two forms, not separated botanically
are associated in our area. They differ in time of flowering, in size,
shape, color and flavor of the fruit, in leaf shape, venation and odor and
color of the bark. They are of constant popular recognition and probably
separate species, never seeming to intergrade."</p>

<p>It is desirable for ornamental planning on account of its interesting
foliage, beautiful and unique flowers and delicious fruit. It is very
difficult to transplant a sucker plant, and in order to get a start of
this species it is best to plant the seed or seedlings. It is usually found
growing in the shade, but does well in full sunlight.</p>

<p>Mr. Arthur W. Osborn of Spiceland, who has done much experimental
work in propagating this species, reports some interesting cases of
pawpaw poisoning. He says he knew a lady whose skin would be
irritated by the presence of pawpaws. Some individuals after eating
them develop a rash with intense itching. In one instance he fed a
person, subject to the rash from eating the pawpaw, a peeled pawpaw
with a spoon, and the subject never touched the pawpaw, and the
results were the same. The American Genetic Association has taken
up the subject of improving the fruit of this tree, and there is no doubt
but that in the future this species will be of considerable economic importance.
The tree is free from all insect enemies, and since it can be
grown in waste places, there is no reason why it should not receive
more attention than it does.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Maine, southern Ontario to Iowa and south to
Florida and west to Texas. No doubt it was formerly found in every
county of Indiana. In the northern part of the State it is more local in
its distribution than in the southern counties. In the northern counties
where it is local it is found in colonies on sandy or clayey ridges. Sassafras
is usually considered an indicator of poorer soils, hence, in the
central counties it is often very local. It is frequent to common throughout
the hilly counties of the southern part of the State. In this part of
the State it becomes a pernicious weed tree. It soon invades fence rows
and fallow fields, and is extremely difficult to kill out. It is rarely found
in wet situations; however, in Sullivan and Clay Counties large trees
have been observed in low alluvial ground, associated with the white
elm, etc.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Wood light, soft, coarse-grained, aromatic, heartwood
brownish. In our area sassafras wood is used principally for posts and
crossties. The roots contain a volatile oil which is much used in medicine
and perfumery. Every one is familiar with the sassafras peddler
who in the Spring sells a small bundle of roots or bark for making
sassafras tea. The tea is reputed "to thin the blood." The aromatic
character of the wood led the earliest inhabitants to attribute many
medicinal and other qualities to the wood which, in many instances
bordered on superstition. In some of the southern States bedsteads
were made of sassafras with the belief that they would produce sounder
sleep. Floors were made of sassafras to keep out the rats and mice.
Perches of chicken houses were made of sassafras poles to keep off the
lice. To successfully make soap, it was necessary to stir the contents
of the kettle with a sassafras stick.</p>

<p>The sassafras is usually about one-fourth of a meter in diameter.
However, on the Charles Hole farm about three miles southeast of
Butlerville grew two of the largest trees of which we have record. The
trees grew within seven meters of each other on a slope now grown up
with large sugar maple. They were cut by Mr. Hole's father, on whose
farm they were located. The largest was cut in the later sixties and the
smaller in the early seventies. The stumps were seen by the writer in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
1918. Both are now hollow although the outside is quite solid after
having been cut about fifty years. Chips were cut from the root spurs
and the wood was almost as aromatic as if the tree had just been cut.
"The stumps have been burned at least three times," says Mr. Hole, yet
the smaller now measures 1.09 m. (43 inches) in diameter at a meter
high. The largest stump now measures 1.22 m. (48 inches), in diameter
at a meter high. Mr. Hole says that the smallest tree had a clear hole
of at least 18 meters, and the largest tree was .92 m. (36 inches) in
diameter 20 meters from the stump.</p>

<p>Sassafras deserves more consideration than it has received as a shade
and ornamental tree. The autumnal coloring of its foliage is scarcely
surpassed by any tree; and it is free from injurious insect pests. It
adapts itself to almost all kinds of soils, and grows rapidly. It is,
however, transplanted with difficulty; this means only more care in
digging the tree and planting it.</p>

<p>Commonly the sassafras is classed as red and white sassafras. The
roots of the white sassafras are said to be whiter, the aroma of the wood
has a suggestion of camphor, and the wood is less durable. This belief is
common throughout the area of its distribution, but so far as the writer
knows, no scientific work has been published to verify this division of
the species.</p>

<p>Sassafras is extremely variable, but most botanical authors have
considered the many variations as one species. Nuttall in 1818 was
the first author to make a division of the forms, and he has been followed
by some recent authors. Nuttall separated those forms with
smooth twigs, buds, and under surface of leaves, from those with pubescent
twigs, buds, and under surface of leaves. Nieuwland<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> separates a
variety from the smooth forms which he calls <b>Sassafras albida</b> variety
<b>glauca</b>, and reports it as occurring in the counties in the vicinity of Lake
Michigan.</p>

<p>The writer has at hand 46 specimens from 41 counties in Indiana,
including all of the Lake Michigan Counties, and he has not been able
to find a single character that is constant enough to make a division of
our forms, consequently all the Indiana forms are included under one
and the old name for sassafras.</p>

Large trees with resinous sap; bark deeply furrowed, grayish; twigs
when very young somewhat hairy, soon becoming glabrous, a light reddish-brown
by the end of the season, later a gray, usually some or all
of the branchlets develop one or more corky ridges running lengthwise
of the branchlets, or in some cases only corky excrescences; leaves
simple, alternate, long-petioled, orbicular in outline, cleft into 5
wedge-shaped lobes, rarely 7 lobes, average blades 5-12 cm. long, truncate
or cordate at the base, margins finely serrate, hairy on both
surfaces on unfolding, soon becoming glabrous above, and remaining
more or less hairy beneath especially in the axils of the veins, at maturity
turning to a dull or brilliant red; flowers in heads, expanding in
April or May; fruit a globular, horny aggregate of carpels, 3-4 cm. in
diameter including the horns; wood heavy, hard, not strong, close-grained,
inclined to shrink and warp in seasoning, takes a good polish,
heart wood a rich brown which can be finished to imitate walnut or
mahogany.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Connecticut, southern Ohio to Missouri, south to
Florida and west to Texas, and in the mountains in Mexico south to
Guatemala. In Indiana it is confined to wet woods in the southern
half of the State. The most northern records are from Franklin, Shelby,
Putnam and Parke Counties. Wherever it is found it is usually a frequent
to a common or very common tree. It is most frequently
associated with the beech, but in the very wet woods it is found with pin
oak, red birch, cow oak and white elm.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This species grows rapidly; is somewhat hard to transplant;
grows straight and tall with few side branches, and adapts itself
to a wet, compact soil. In the "flats" of southern Indiana where it is
associated with pin oak, red birch and beech, it is to be preferred for
forest planting to these or any other species that could be grown in
the "flats." It is practically free from all injurious insects. Sweet
gum should be one of the principal species in wet places of the woodlots
of southern Indiana.</p>

<p>This species is one of the best for ornamental planting in all parts
of the State where it is hardy. It is doubtful if it is wise to use it in
the northern part of the State. Several trees in the northern part of
the State are known to be quite hardy, but there are reports that it
sometimes winter-kills. It can also be recommended for roadside and
street planting.</p>

the winter months; wood heavy, hard, weak, close-grained, difficult to
split and work, takes a high polish; when used as a container it does not
communicate an objectional taste or odor to contents.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Maine, Ontario to Nebraska, south to the Gulf
States and west to Texas. Found in all parts of Indiana, although there
are no records for the extreme northwestern counties. It is a tree of a
low ground habitat, and is found principally in low ground along
streams, about lakes, and ponds. In such habitats it is a frequent tree in
all parts, except in the "flats" of the southern counties. In some places
it is a common to a very common tree, especially along the upper
courses of White River.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;In this State this species is always called the sycamore
tree. It is the largest tree of the State, and the largest deciduous
tree of the United States. Indiana has the distinction of having the
largest living sycamore in the United States. It is located near
Worthington, Indiana, and "in 1915, measured 43 feet and 3 inches in
circumference at five feet above the ground." See frontispiece. The
sycamore grew to great diameters in all parts of the State. It was commonly
hollow, because it is believed the tree in early life is usually
more or less injured by floating ice and debris which starts inner decay.
Hollow sycamore logs were commonly used by the pioneers in which
to smoke their meat, and sections of hollow logs about 12 dm. (4 feet)
long were used to store grain in, and were known as "gums."</p>

<p>The value of sycamore lumber has been very much underestimated.
It has many uses such as butcher blocks, interior finish, furniture,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
piling, tobacco boxes, veneer berry boxes, handles, wooden ware, etc.
Indiana has led in the production of sycamore lumber for years.</p>

<p>The sycamore is well adapted for shade, ornamental and forestry
purposes. It transplants easily, grows rapidly, stands pruning well
and is comparatively free from injurious insects. It grows straight,
tall and usually with a rather narrow crown. It prefers a moist soil,
but adapts itself to dry situations. For planting overflow lands, or
on the banks of streams it is one of the best species we have. It is
also one of the best species for roadside tree planting, because it is
deep rooted, grows tall, and does not produce a dense shade.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Central New York, lower peninsula Michigan,
western New Jersey to northern Alabama and Missouri. Found in all
parts of Indiana. No doubt in the original forests it was rare, but the
removal of the large trees has been favorable to its growth until today it
is somewhat frequent in moist open woods, along streams and neglected
fences. It is most frequent among the hills in southern Indiana, and in
all its distribution it is usually found in clumps.</p>

<p>In our area it is a small tree about 10-20 cm. (4-8 inches) in diameter
and 4-6 m. (12-18 feet) high, with a spreading crown. An exceptionally
large tree is located on the south bank of Round Lake in Whitley
County which measures 1.3 m. (51 inches) in circumference at one meter
(3 feet) above the ground where the first branch appears.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Massachusetts to Florida, west to Manitoba and
south to New Mexico. Found throughout Indiana. While it has a
general distribution, it is not generally distributed through the forests,
but is local in colonies in low grounds along streams or in low places in
the forest. In the southern counties it is found on the ridges and commonly
about the basins of sink-holes. Large single trees may be found
but they are usually surrounded by many smaller ones which are root
shoots. From this habit of the tree to produce root shoots large colonies
are formed which has given rise to the term "plum thickets."</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;The wood of this tree is of no economic importance, but
the species from a horticultural standpoint is one of the most important
of all of the plums. Many named varieties belong to this species.</p>

<p>It should be noted that all species of plums are quite variable, and
one must not be surprised to find specimens that will not come entirely
within the descriptions.</p>

acute or short acuminate at the apex, margins sharply serrate, or
doubly serrate, upper surface covered with short appressed hairs, lower
surface permanently pubescent with longer hairs; petioles more or less
pubescent and often bearing one or more glands; flowers appear in
April or May in umbels of 2-4, upper part of calyx, and its lobes pubescent
both inside and out, the lobes more or less cut-toothed and
bearing inconspicuous glands; fruit ripening in September, globose,
reddish with a bluish bloom; stone nearly orbicular and turgid.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Indiana west to Indian Territory and south to the
Gulf. The range of this variety has not been well understood, and it is
believed that forms of this variety in the northern part of its range
have been included in the preceding species. It is certain that in our
area the two forms are separated with difficulty; especially is this
true of certain individuals. Specimens at hand show it to occur in
Floyd, Clark, Bartholomew, Martin, Warren, Vermillion, Gibson,
Warrick, and Perry Counties.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;New Brunswick to Massachusetts and west to
Minnesota and south to central Indiana. In Indiana it is definitely
known only from Wells, Blackford and Marion Counties. No doubt it
ranges throughout the northern part of Indiana, but it has not been
separated from <i>Prunus americana</i>. Higley and Raddin<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> in 1891, when
our text books did not separate this species, in a flora which included a
part of Lake County Indiana, remark: "There are two distinct forms of
<i>Prunus americana</i>; one with slender branches and large flowers with
glandular calyx, found in swamps and another found with stout
branches and much smaller flowers with the calyx less glandular, grows
in dry soil." This no doubt refers to the species under discussion.</p>

<p>In 1898 the author found this species growing in a swamp in Wells
County, and transplanted a specimen to high ground in his orchard. It
has persisted ever since, growing vigorously and freely suckering from
the roots, but it has been quite susceptible to the San Jose scale.</p>

County for miles on the wooded bank of the terrace of the Wabash
River.</p>

roughened near the base on old trees; twigs smooth, at least at maturity;
leaves oval, oval-lanceolate, or ovate, sometimes slightly falcate, 4-10
cm. long, and 1.5-4 cm. wide, rounded or narrowed at the base, long
acuminate at the apex, margins finely serrate with glandular incurved
teeth, glossy and smooth above, generally smooth beneath, sometimes
pubescent along the midrib and veins, petioles generally smooth, rarely
pubescent; flowers appear with the leaves in May in umbels of 3-7, or
sometimes raceme-like but the rachis shorter than the pedicels; calyx
glabrous, the lobes glabrous within and without, entire and glandless;
fruit ripens in August, globose, 6-7 mm. in diameter, red; stone roundish-oval,
surface granular.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Newfoundland and New England to the Rocky
Mountains, south to Colorado and eastward through northern Indiana
to Pennsylvania and thence in the mountains to North Carolina. In
Indiana it is definitely known to occur only in Lake, Porter, Laporte,
St. Joseph and Lagrange Counties. It is frequently found on the black
oak ridges about Lake Michigan. All other reports of this species for
Indiana should be looked upon with suspicion. The one by Chipman
from Kosciusko County may be correct. The one by Ridgway<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
for Posey County is undoubtedly an error. No doubt Phinney's<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
record for Central Eastern Indiana (Jay, Delaware, Randolph and
Wayne Counties) is an error.</p>

<p>The range of the species is to the north of our area, and like a few
others it is found about the Great Lakes south of its general range. In
Ohio it is reported only from Cuyahoga County which borders Lake
Erie.</p>

Black Cherry.</b> <a href="#Plate_104">Plate 104.</a> Medium to large sized trees; bark of
young trees smooth, becoming on old trees irregularly fissured and
separating in small scaly plates; twigs slender and smooth, sometimes
pubescent while young; leaves oval, oblong-oval, ovate or narrowly
ovate, generally 5-12 cm. long and 2-4 cm. wide, generally narrowed at
the base, sometimes rounded, short or long acuminate at the apex,
margin finely serrate with incurved sharp callous teeth, smooth above

appear in May, when the leaves are almost grown, on the ends of
the year's growth, in racemes generally 5-10 cm. long; fruit ripens in
July and August, globose, about 6-10 mm. in diameter, dark red to
almost black.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Nova Scotia to South Dakota, south to Florida and
west to Texas. Found in all parts of Indiana. It prefers a moist loose
soil and is usually found with beech, sugar maple, tulip, white ash and
white oak. In the original forest it was a rare to a frequent tree, and
only rarely and locally did it ever become common. It grew to be several
feet in diameter and was as tall as the highest trees of the forest. The
trunk of the tree, however, was inclined to be crooked. It has now
become a frequent tree along fences.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;The wood of wild cherry from pioneer times has been a
favorite wood, and for this reason the tree soon disappeared and today
large trees are very rare. The wood is strong, close-grained, reddish-brown,
and very much resembles mahogany. In value it stands second
in Indiana woods. It is used principally for furniture, office and store
fixtures.</p>

<p>The wild cherry grows readily from seed; is not difficult to transplant;
adapts itself to almost all kinds of soils and grows rapidly. In Spring
it is one of the very first trees to put out its leaves. It is not shade
enduring, which no doubt, in a great measure, accounts for its rarity
in the primeval forests. When grown in the open the tree usually
produces an abundance of fruit which is much relished by birds. This
species has many good features, and might be used to advantage in
forest planting.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;In Canada along the shores of Lake Erie and Ontario,
New York west through Michigan to Iowa, south to the Gulf States
and west to Texas. Found throughout Indiana except there are no
records from the counties bordering Lake Michigan. In the northern
part of the State it is rare or frequent in alluvial soil along streams or in
rich woods. In the southern part of the State it is a frequent to a
common tree in ravines and on slopes. It is never found in wet situations,
and consequently is absent in the "flats" of the southern counties.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;The redbud is the common name for this tree throughout
the State. In one locality it was known as the fish blossom because
the larger fish spawn when this tree is in flower. In text books it is

5-10 m. high. It is of no economic importance and is classed as a weed
tree in the woodlot and should be removed.</p>

<p>It is frequently recommended for ornamental planting. It prefers
a rich moist soil, and is shade enduring, although it succeeds best in the
open or in a light shade.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Pennsylvania, southern Michigan to Iowa, and
south to the Gulf States and west to Texas. Found infrequently
throughout Indiana along streams, except that it is absent about Lake
Michigan and that in the southwestern counties it becomes a frequent
tree in the Wabash bottoms. In its native habitat it is rarely found
except near a stream, pond, lake, etc. However, in the southeastern
counties it has spread all over many of the hillsides which were once
cleared and have been abandoned for agricultural purposes and left
to natural forest regeneration. It was interesting to learn how this tree
was able to propagate itself on the steep bare slopes. It was found that
the seeds were scattered by cattle that greedily eat the fruit. It is a
medium sized tree, except in the Wabash bottoms of the southwestern
part of the State where it grows to be one of the largest trees of the
forest, and is more luxuriant than in any other part of its range.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;In making a study of the fruit of this species, it was
found that the sides of all the pods of all the specimens at hand
except one are glabrous, even those of young fruit. The margins of the
pods are pubescent. However, a specimen collected on August 27th in
Vermillion County has the entire pod covered with long hairs. In
consulting the literature on the subject it is found that some authors
describe the fruit as glabrous while others describe it as hairy. It would
be interesting to study the significance of this character to learn if each
form has a geographic range.</p>

<p>The wood is used principally for interior finish, furniture, posts
and crossties. The tree has a grace that recommends it for ornamental
planting despite its thorns. However, a thornless variety is now offered
by nurserymen. It adapts itself to all kinds of soils, although it
prefers a moist rich soil; grows rapidly and is comparatively free from
insect damage.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Atlantic Coast from North Carolina south to
Florida, and the Mississippi Valley from southwestern Indiana southward
to Texas. In Indiana this species is rare and limited to the banks
of river sloughs, locally called ponds and to one cypress swamp. It is
known to have occurred on the banks of Wabash and Dan's ponds and
Little Cypress swamp in the southwest corner of Knox County, and in
Gibson County on the bank of a slough near Skelton and about Burnett's
pond. The reference to Posey County is without a verifying
specimen, although it may be found in the county. The writer has
visited about every place in the county where the species might occur,
and has never found it. Gorby's<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> reference for Miami County is without
doubt an error. In our area it is a low crooked tree and grows with
its base submerged more or less during the year. The idea of the proportions
of this tree can be obtained from the measurements taken from
the largest tree now known in Indiana, which is located on the shore of
Dan's pond in Knox County. It measures 158 cm. (66 inches) in circumference
at 1 m. above the ground, and is estimated to be 10 m. (30
feet) high. This species is too rare to be of economic importance.</p>

<p><a name="Gleditsia_aquatica_x" id="Gleditsia_aquatica_x"></a><b>Gleditsia aquatica × triacanthos.</b> Dr. Schneck<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> found two honey
locust trees which he described as hybrids of the two species. The one
was located on the bank of Dan's pond in Knox County, and the other
in Gibson County. The original description is as follows: "In both
instances the pods are the distinguishing feature. These are very
much alike in both trees, being about 5 inches long, 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches wide,
smooth, shining, of a light brown color and entirely destitute of pulp.
Otherwise the tree cannot be distinguished from the trees among
which they stand. They are both about 50 feet high, with short
stems and spreading branches, and stand about 5 miles apart." The
writer has five fruiting specimens from these two trees, taken by Dr.
Schneck. Two of the sheets have the round and branched spines of
<i>G. triacanthos</i>.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;New York, southwestern Ontario to southern
Minnesota south to Tennessee and Arkansas. This species has been
reported or is known to exist in 33 counties in various parts of the State.
It no doubt was native to every county of the State, except it be those
bordering Lake Michigan from which we have no reports. It is a rare
tree in all parts. Only exceptionally is it found even frequently. A
few trees may be found in one place, and it will not be found again for
many miles. No doubt there are many areas with a radius of 5 to 10
miles where this tree never occurred. It is usually found in alluvial
soil along streams, or nearby terraces.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This species generally is not very tall, and is usually
found in open places in the forest or cut-over lands. However, one
specimen was seen in Posey County that was as tall as a specimen of
pecan of equal size that grew nearby. This species was so rare in this
vicinity that I was asked to drive three miles to identify this tree which
no one could name.</p>

<p>Coffeenut, which is sometimes called Kentucky coffeenut, has always
been so rare as to be of little economic importance. It has no qualities
to recommend it for ornamental planting.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Appalachian Mountains from Pennsylvania south
to northern Georgia, and in Arkansas. In Indiana it is found as an
escape in all parts and was doubtless native along the Ohio River, at
least in the southeastern part of the State. Thomas<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> says: "We had
gazed at the majestic beech of this country (near Rising Sun) three feet
in diameter; we had seen the honey locust, the black walnut, a buckeye
of equal magnitude; and then we saw with surprise, the black locust
almost a rival in stature." Drake<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> says: "The flowering locust is
abundant in Kentucky. Along the Ohio River it is rarely found more
than 30 miles north of the river."</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This tree is generally known as the locust tree, but is
sometimes called the yellow locust.</p>

<p>Locust wood is somewhat lighter than white oak, but it is 34 percent
stiffer and 45 per cent stronger. These remarkable qualities added to its
durability in contact with the ground make it one of the most desirable
trees for forest planting. The wood has been used principally for
posts, ties, tree nails, etc. The locust when grown close together
usually grows to 8-12 inches in diameter. There are, however, specimens
that have grown in the open that are almost three feet in diameter. The
pioneers used it extensively for ornamental planting, and it has escaped
from such planting in all parts of the State. It propagates easily by
root shoots which is the principal mode of spreading, except where the
seed fall on exposed soil.</p>

<p>The locust has of recent years been extensively planted for post
timber. It is very easily propagated from seedlings and grows rapidly.
It is adapted to all kinds of soil, except a wet one. It prefers a well
drained soil and seems to grow as fast in a loose clay soil as in a
black loam. When used for forest planting the spacing should be from
5×5 feet to 8×8 feet. The spacing should be governed by the quality
of the soil, and the amount of pruning that can be done. The locust
has the habit of having the terminal to end in a fork and having one
or more very large side branches. The best management requires
that the very large side branches be removed as soon as they are noted,
and one part of the terminal forks be cut off.</p>

<p>The locust until recently gave great promise of being an important
tree for planting sterile, washed and eroded slopes, on which it usually
thrives and in many cases grows thriftily. However, reports from all
parts of the State show that locust groves wherever planted are being
killed by the locust body borer. The locust has also been attacked by
the twig borer, bag worm and the leaf miner. At present there are no
known economic means of controlling these destructive pests, and until
they can be controlled, the planting of locust for commercial purposes

sized trees with dark gray bark, thin, rough or fissured on old trees;
branchlets very robust; twigs smooth; leaves compound and very large,
especially on coppice shoots, usually about 4-6 dm. long, odd-pinnate,
arranged spirally on the branchlets; leaflets 13-41, ovate-oblong, acuminate,
oblique at base, entire or with a few blunt teeth toward the base,
smooth or hairy when they unfold, becoming smooth at maturity, dark

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;A native of China. Introduced and spreading in
cities, and into fields and woods in the southern part of the State.
The most notable occurrence is in Jefferson County on the wooded
bluffs of the Ohio River between Madison and Hanover.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Where the sugar and black maple can not be used for
shade tree planting this tree should receive attention. It adapts itself to
all kinds of soils, and to all kinds of growing conditions such as smoke,
etc. The crown is of an oval or rounded type. It stands pruning and
injury to trunk or branches quite well. It is practically free from
all diseases and insect injury. The leaves appear late but they do not
fall until the first killing frost when they are killed, and frequently
practically all of the leaves will fall in one day. The staminate flowers
exhale a fetid odor for a few days which is about the only objectionable
feature in this tree. In order to obviate this objection, nurserymen are
now offering for sale pistillate trees which have been grafted on common
stock.</p>

tree with a short trunk and round head; bark of young trees
smooth and gray, becoming thick on old trees, light to dark brown
and more or less furrowed or rarely somewhat flaky; twigs smooth and
greenish; leaves of average size are 1.5-3 dm. long, generally with 3
leaflets on the flowering branches, sometimes 5 or rarely with 7, on
sterile branches or on growing shoots 3-7, the petioles generally <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
the length of the leaf and glabrous or nearly so at maturity; leaflets
all on stalks more or less pubescent, the lateral stalks short, the
terminal ones much longer, leaflets of varying size and shape, the margins
usually varying from lobed to serrate or entire, pinnately veined,
smooth above at maturity and remaining more or less pubescent beneath,
especially along the veins; flowers appear just before the leaves
the last of April or the first of May, the staminate and pistillate on
separate trees; fruit matures late in summer, the body of the samara
green and more or less pubescent.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;New England to Florida, west to Minnesota and
south to eastern Texas. In Indiana, it is found throughout the State in
moist or wet places along creeks and rivers, and infrequently on the
highlands along roadsides and fences. Its original distribution in the
State can only be conjectured. Judging from its tolerance to shade and
its habitat, and from the earliest reports of its occurrence in the State,
this species was quite rare in the northern part of the State, becoming
infrequent to frequent in its habitat in the southern part of the State.
Even today it is rather local in its distribution. I have never seen it on
the low mucky border of a lake.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This species on account of its rapid growth was formerly
much used in our area as a shade tree. It is believed that most of the
trees now found along roadsides, fences, clearings and on the drier
banks of streams are from seed distributed by the wind from planted
trees. This species is now little used as a shade tree and is never recommended
because it sheds its leaves early, and is subject to injury from
disease and insects.</p>

somewhat cordate at the base, sometimes truncate, deeply 3-lobed, each
of the lateral lobes with an additional lobe below, margins of all of the
lobes more or less irregular or even lobed, the two principal sinuses
generally show a tendency to close, leaves hairy beneath when young,
glabrous above and below at maturity and very glaucous beneath;
flowers appear in March or April in the axils of the leaves of the previous
year, the staminate and pistillate in separate clusters on the same or
different trees; fruit on pedicels 1.5-6 cm. long, maturing in the spring
or early summer, green, densely hairy while young and remaining more
or less hairy at maturity, 4-7 cm. long, wings 1-2 cm. wide.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;New Brunswick to Florida, west to South Dakota
and south to Texas. Locally frequent to very common in all parts of
Indiana. This species is always found in wet or moist places, and in the
lower Wabash bottoms in low overflow lands or in or about old sloughs
it often forms the principal stand. It is more frequently associated with
black willow, white elm, red birch, sycamore, etc.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;The silver maple has been used extensively for shade
tree planting. The branches are very brittle, and ice storms sometimes
break off so many branches that the tree may be badly injured. The
shade trees of this species are in many parts of the state being killed
by scale insects, and for this reason it should not be used. On account
of its rapid growth it has also been much used for windbreaks but this
practice should be discouraged and better species used.</p>

long, generally red, sometimes green, glabrous at maturity, rarely somewhat
pubescent, 1.5-3.5 cm. long.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Newfoundland to Florida, west to Minnesota and
south to Texas. It is found in all parts of Indiana. Its preferred
habitat is that of low ground about lakes, swamps, along streams and
in the "flats" in the southeast part of the State. Throughout its range
in Indiana where it is found in low ground, it is in places rich in organic
matter, except in the "flats" of the southern part of the State where it
grows in a hard clay soil with sweet gum, red birch, etc. In contrast
the silver maple is generally found growing in wet places with little
organic matter; especially is this true in the lower Wabash bottoms.
The red maple grows also on high ground. In the northern part of the
State it is only an occasional tree of gravelly ridges or on high ground
about lakes or along streams. In the southern part of the State it is a
local to a frequent tree in most parts of the "knob" area where it is
associated with white oak, black oak, black gum, etc. It is also an
occasional tree on the top of bluffs and cliffs.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;The red maple is not abundant enough in Indiana to be
of any economic importance. It grows rapidly and should replace the
silver maple for shade tree planting since its branches are not broken off
as easily by ice storms and it is more resistant to insect attack.</p>

<p><a name="Acer_rubrum_3a" id="Acer_rubrum_3a"></a><b>3a. Acer rubrum</b> variety <b>Drummóndii</b> (Hooker and Arnott)
Torrey and Gray. This variety of the red maple is a form found in the
dense swamps of the lower Wabash Valley. It is distinguished from the
type by its twigs which generally remain more or less hairy until maturity;
by the under surface of the leaves remaining more or less tomentose
during the summer, and by its larger fruit. This variety is known with
certainty only from Little Cypress Swamp in Knox County about 12
miles southwest of Decker. Here it is a frequent to a common tree
associated with cypress, swell-butt ash, button-bush, sweet gum, etc.
All of the trees of this locality have 5-lobed leaves.</p>

Plate 114. Medium to large sized trees with dark furrowed bark on old
trees; leaves a little wider than long, 6-15 cm. long, on petioles usually
3-15 cm. long which are more or less swollen at the base and by maturity
develop a scale like appendage on each side of the petiole at the base&mdash;especially
on each of the terminal pair of leaves, sometimes with foliar
stipules which are 2-3 cm. long on stalks of equal length, leaves with
three main lobes, the two lower lobes generally have a small lobe at their
base, margins of lobes entire and undulating, sinuses between main
lobes generally rounded at the base, wide and shallow, base with a
narrow sinus, the lower lobes often overlapping, rarely somewhat dentate,
dark green above and a paler yellow green below, hairy on both
surfaces when young, becoming at maturity glabrous above and remaining
more or less pubescent beneath; flowers appear in May when
the leaves are about half grown on long hairy pedicels, the staminate
and pistillate in separate clusters on the same or different trees; fruit
matures in autumn, the samaras about 3 cm. long.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Quebec to Georgia, west to South Dakota and south
to Louisiana. Found in all parts of Indiana and invariably associated
with sugar maple, and often with beech in addition. Frequently almost
pure stands of sugar maple may be found with the black maple absent.
Where found it is usually a frequent to common tree, and when it occurs
on a wooded slope it is more frequent near the base and appears to be
able to advance farther into moist situations than its congener.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This tree cannot be distinguished from the sugar maple
by its form, but at short range can be separated from it by its richer
green foliage and by the drooping habit of the lower lobes of the leaves.
It is commonly separated from the sugar maple by the darker color and
by the narrower and shallower furrows of the bark, but these characters
will not always separate the two species. Hence, when buying black
maple trees from a nurseryman you may receive the sugar maple.
Those who distinguish the two species agree that the black maple is the
more desirable tree for shade tree planting. The black and sugar
maple are the two most desirable trees for shade tree planting in
Indiana. They are long lived, have a very desirable form, beautiful
foliage, a long leaf period, and are quite free from disease and insect
injury.</p>

bark of small trees is smooth or rough, becoming fissured on old trees,
tight or on very old trees sometimes the ridges loosen on one edge and
turn outward. The leaves are extremely variable on different trees,
and frequently show a wide variation on the same tree, as to form and
in the presence or absence of hairs on the petioles and on the under
surface of the leaves. In our area all of the forms which have the majority
of the leaves longer than wide or about as wide as long, may be
considered as falling within the type. The average sized leaves are
6-12 cm. long, 3-5 lobed, more or less cordate at the base, generally with
a broad sinus, sometimes truncate or slightly wedge-shape, sinuses
generally wide-angled and rounded at the base, sometimes acute, hairy
beneath when young, becoming smooth at maturity except for a few
hairs along the veins or in the main axils of the veins, or sometimes
remaining more or less pubescent over the whole under surface, more
or less glaucous beneath; flowers appear in April or May, on hairy
pedicels 3-7 cm. long, the staminate and pistillate in clusters on the
same or different trees; fruit ripening in autumn, samaras glabrous and
usually 2-4 cm. long.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Newfoundland to Georgia, west to Manitoba and
south to Texas. A frequent to a very common tree in all parts of Indiana.
It is confined to rich uplands, or along streams in well drained
alluvial soil. Throughout our area it is constantly associated with
the beech. It is absent in the "flats" of the southeastern part of the
State, and on the crest of the ridges of the "knob" area of Indiana, but
it is a frequent or common tree on the lower slopes of the spurs of the
"knobs."</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;The under surface of the leaves of the sugar maple in
the northern part of its range are green, while those of the southern
part of its range are quite glaucous beneath. To distinguish these two
intergrading forms the southern form has been called <b>Acer saccharum</b>
var. <b>glaucum</b> Sargent<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. All of the trees seen in Indiana have leaves
more or less glaucous beneath. This character, however, is not
always evident in dried specimens. The writer prefers not to apply
the varietal name to the forms of our area. The sugar maple always
has been and will continue to be one of the most important trees of the
State. In its mass distribution in Indiana it ranks not less than third.
In the quality and uses of its wood it is equalled or exceeded only by
the oak, ash and hickory. When compared with white oak it is a little
lighter but thirty per cent stronger and fifty-three per cent stiffer.
The greatest amount of the annual cut of maple is worked into flooring
which is shipped to all parts of the world. It is much used in the
manufacture of furniture and ranks third in use for veneer and hard
wood distillation, and as a fuel wood is excelled only by hickory. Since
pioneer times, the sap of this tree has been made into sirup and sugar
and their manufacture now forms a valuable industry. On an average
it takes 3 to 4 gallons of sap to make a pound of sugar, and an average
sized tree will annually yield about 3 to 4 pounds of sugar.</p>

<p>The sugar maple on account of its slow growth has not been used much
in reforestation. It is very tolerant of shade, can adapt itself to almost
all kinds of soils, thrives either in a pure or mixed stand, and is practically
free from injury of insects and diseases. It has, however, been
extensively used as a shade tree. For this purpose it is scarcely excelled
by any other tree. When grown in the open it almost invariably
assumes a symmetrical oval form, and the autumnal coloration of its
foliage is rarely surpassed by any of our trees. Where a large tree is
desired for street or ornamental planting the sugar maple can safely be
recommended.</p>

<p><a name="Acer_saccharum_5a" id="Acer_saccharum_5a"></a><b>5a. Acer saccharum</b> variety <b>Rugélii</b> (Pax) Rehder. This variety
of the sugar maple has leaves much wider than long, smaller and 3-lobed.
The lobes are long acuminate and usually entire, sometimes the
lower lobe has a small lobe near the base. This variety is included in our
flora on the authority of C. S. Sargent who has given this name to
specimens from Indiana in the writer's herbarium. The specimens so
named are from the southern part of the State. While there is a wide
range of difference in the shape of the leaves of the typical 5-lobed
<i>Acer saccharum</i> and its variety <i>Rugelii</i>, all intermediate forms can be
easily found. The leaves of a tree will vary most on those trees whose
average shaped leaves are farthest from the typical form.</p>

<p><a name="Acer_saccharum_5b" id="Acer_saccharum_5b"></a><b>5b. Acer saccharum</b> variety <b>Schnéckii</b> Rehder. This variety in
its extreme form is well marked by having the petioles and under surface
of the leaves densely covered with hairs. The variety is characterized
by having a "fulvous pubescence," but the 18 specimens at hand show
the color of the pubescence on both young and mature specimens to
range from white to fulvous. The leaves of all specimens at hand are
5-lobed and show a variation of leaves with petioles and under surface of
leaves densely pubescent to those with petioles glabrous and with densely
pubescent under surface. The habitat is that of a dry soil and associated
with beech. It has been found in Gibson, Martin, Perry, Posey
and Vanderburgh counties.</p>

oval-oblong, or obovate, about 1 dm. long, acuminate, narrowed to a
wedge-shaped base, more or less pubescent beneath until maturity, especially
along the principal veins, margins irregularly serrate except
near the base; flowers generally appear in May when the leaves are
almost full size, but in the southern part of the State the flowers
sometimes appear the last of March, flower clusters 1-1.5 dm. long, the
whole inflorescence usually densely covered with white hairs, flowers
pale-greenish yellow; fruit a globular spiny capsule, generally 3-6 cm.

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Pennsylvania south to Alabama, west to Iowa and
south to the Indian Territory. Found in all parts of Indiana. It is
usually associated with beech, sugar maple and linn. On account of the
poisonous character of its fruit, land owners have almost exterminated
it.</p>

<p>From the data at hand it appears that the buckeye was a rare tree
in the northern tier of counties. However, as soon as the basin of the
Wabash is reached it becomes a frequent to a common tree where beech,
sugar maple, and linn are found. In all of our area it prefers a rich
moist soil, except in the southern counties it may be found even on the
bluffs of streams with the species just named. In the lower Wabash
Valley especially in Posey County it was a rare tree, or entirely absent.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;In our area the buckeye is the very first tree to put out
its leaves. On this account in early Spring it can be easily distinguished
in the forest. This character together with its large clusters of flowers
which appear early are features which recommend it for shade tree and
ornamental planting. The tree has now become so rare in Indiana
as to have no economic importance.</p>

Plate 117. Medium to large sized trees with smooth bark which on old

from which it can be easily distinguished by the following characters.
Its smoother and lighter colored bark; by the entire under surface
of the leaves remaining permanently pubescent; the hairs more or less
fulvous; by the included anthers; and by its smooth capsule.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Western Pennsylvania, westward along the Ohio to
Iowa, south to Georgia and west to Louisiana and Texas. In Indiana it
is confined to a few counties along the Ohio River. The records of
McCaslin for Jay and Phinney for Delaware counties are doubtless
errors in determination. The writer has diligently tried to extend the
range of this species in Indiana and has found it only in Dearborn,
Jefferson, Clark and Crawford Counties, and in no place more than a
mile from the Ohio River. No doubt under favorable situations it
found its way to a greater distance from the River. On account of the
poisonous character of its fruit, it has been almost exterminated, and
only along the precipitous bluffs of the Ohio River are trees yet to be
found. Doubtless its exact range in our area can never be determined.
Dr. Drake<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> minutely described this species and remarks: "This species
delights in rich hills, and is seldom seen far from the Ohio River. It
frequently arrives at the height of 100 feet and the diameter of four feet."</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;The wood is soft, white and resembles the sap wood of
the tulip tree for which wood it is commonly sold. Too rare in Indiana
to be of economic importance. Young<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> reported a purple flowered form
of buckeye from Jefferson County, but since no specimen was preserved
and the size of the plant is not given, it will not be considered here. The
form was reported as rare under the name of <b>Æsculus flava</b> var. <b>purpurascens</b>.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;New Brunswick to Manitoba, south to Georgia and
west to Texas. More or less frequent to common in rich moist soil in
all parts of Indiana. It is the most frequent and common in the lake
area of the State but was almost as frequent and common throughout
the central part of the State until the hilly area is reached where its
habitat disappears for the greater part. In the hill area it is confined to
the basins of streams, although sometimes found on the high rocky bluffs
of streams. Rare or absent in the flats. In most of its area it is associated
with white ash, slippery elm, beech, maple, shellbark hickory, etc.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Wood soft, light, straight and close-grained, white and
seasons well. On account of its softness and lightness it has always been
a favorite wood where these two factors were important considerations.

<p>In Indiana this species is commonly called linn, and only in a few
counties near the Michigan line is it known as basswood. The name
basswood is a corruption of the name bastwood, meaning the inner
tough and fibrous part of the bark, which was used by pioneers for tying
shocks of corn, and other cordage purposes. However, Dr. Schneck
gives the name whittle-wood as one of its common names; and in some
localities it is called bee tree, because bees find its flowers rich in honey.</p>

<p>Linn is adapted to a rich moist soil, transplants fairly well, and
grows rapidly. It has been used to some extent as an ornamental and
shade tree, but its use as a street shade tree is no longer recommended
because it is not adapted to city conditions, and is killed by the scale.
It could, however, be recommended as an integral part of a windbreak,
or woodlot where the land owner has an apiary.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;This species as understood by Sargent ranges from
West Virginia to Indiana and south to Florida and west to Alabama.
In Indiana it is confined to counties near the Ohio River. Specimens are
in the writer's herbarium from Dearborn, Ripley, Switzerland, Jefferson,
Clark, Harrison, Crawford, Perry, southeastern Dubois and east
Spencer Counties. Practically in all of its range in Indiana it is found on
the tops of high bluffs along streams or on the slopes of deep ravines.
It is an infrequent to a common tree where found. In general in the
counties just mentioned it supplants the other species of <i>Tilia</i>. It was
reported from Wayne County by Phinney, and Schneck says a single
tree was found near the mouth of White River. The last named tree
may be <i>Tilia neglecta</i> which is said to be found just west in Illinois.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Wood and uses similar to that of the preceding species.
In Indiana the species are not commercially separated.</p>

<p>A satisfactory division of the species of <i>Tilia</i> of the United States has
long been a puzzle. C. S. Sargent<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> has recently published his studies
of the species and credits Indiana with two species and one variety.
His range of <i>Tilia neglecta</i> might include a part of Indiana, and it may
be that the pubescent forms of <i>Tilia glabra</i> in our area should be referred
to that species. Specimens No. 28043 and 28047 in the writer's herbarium
collected from trees on the high bluff of Graham Creek in Jennings
County, Sargent refers to <b>Tilia heterophylla</b> variety <b>Michauxii</b>
Sargent. While Sargent's key to <i>Tilia</i> quite distinctly separates the
species and varieties, yet when specimens are collected from an area where
the species overlap and seem to intergrade, the task of referring a
specimen to the proper species or variety is not an easy one. In fact
the writer acknowledges his inability to satisfactorily classify our forms
of <i>Tilia</i>, and the present arrangement should be accepted as provisional.</p>

an infrequent to a very rare tree in the northern half of the State, becoming

the northern part of the State it is usually found on dry ground associated
with the oaks, although it is also found with sugar maple and
beech.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Wood heavy, soft, very difficult to split. Woodsmen
always speak of two kinds of black gum. There is one form which splits
easily which is designated as "yellow gum." This distinction has not
been substantiated. The uses of gum are many. The quality of not
splitting makes many uses for it. The greater amount of gum is used
as rough stuff. In the manufactures it is used for mine rollers, heading,
boxes, hatter's blocks, water pipes, firearms, wooden ware, musical
instruments, etc.</p>

<p>The distinctive habit of growth of the black gum together with the
gorgeous coloring of the autumnal foliage recommend this species for
ornamental planting. It has an upright habit of growth, although the
trunk is more or less crooked. The crown when grown in the open is
usually pyramidal, composed of horizontal crooked branches.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Southern Maine, southern Ontario, southern Michigan,
to Missouri and south to Florida and west to Texas. Found in all
parts of Indiana. Frequent to very common in all beech-sugar maple
woods of the State. It is very rare or absent in the prairie area of the
northwest part of the State, although it has been found in upland
woods in all of the counties bordering Lake Michigan. It is also a frequent
or more common tree in most parts of the State associated with
white oak, or in the southern part of the State with black and white oak.
It prefers a dry habitat, and is rarely found in wet situations.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Wood hard, heavy, strong, close-grained and takes a
high polish. The Indians made a scarlet dye from the roots. It was
used much by the pioneers for wedges, mallets and handles for tools.
The trees are so small that they do not produce much wood. The
present supply is used principally for shuttles, golfheads, brush blocks,
engraver's blocks, etc.</p>

<p>The mature fruit is much relished by squirrels and birds.</p>

<p>The tree is quite conspicuous in the flowering season, and when the
fruit is maturing. These features recommend it for ornamental planting,
and it is used to some extent. The tree has a flat crown, and is
quite shade enduring. It is very difficult to transplant, and when the
tree is transplanted, if possible, some earth taken from under a live dogwood
tree, should be used to fill in the hole where it is planted.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;A tree of the elevated regions of the area from
southeastern Pennsylvania to Florida and west to southern Indiana
and south to Louisiana. In Indiana it is definitely known to occur only
in Perry County at the base of a beech spur of the Van Buren Ridge about
7 miles southeast of Cannelton. Here it is a common tree over an area
of an acre or two. The largest tree measured was about 1.5 dm. in
diameter and 12 meters high. Here it is associated with beech, sugar
maple, dogwood, sassafras, etc. When coppiced it grows long slender
shoots which the boys of the pioneers used for arrows. A pioneer who
lived near this colony of trees is the author of this use of the wood and
he called the tree "arrow wood."</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Connecticut to Iowa and south to the Gulf. In
Indiana it is confined to the south half of the State. We have no
record of wild trees being found north of Indianapolis, except Prof.
Stanley Coulter reports three trees growing in Tippecanoe County in
situations such as to indicate that they are native. It is doubtful if it
was ever more than a frequent tree in the original forest. In some of
the hill counties of the south central part of the State, it has become a
common tree in clearings and abandoned fields. It grows long surface
roots from which numerous suckers grow which form the "persimmon
thickets." It seems to thrive in the poorest and hardest of soils.
However, it reaches its greatest size in the alluvial bottoms of the
Lower Wabash Valley. Here large and tall trees have been observed
on the low border of sloughs, associated with such water-loving plants as
water-locust, button-bush, swell-butt ash, etc. It thrives equally well
on the high sandy ridges of Knox and Sullivan Counties.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;The fruit is edible and the horticultural possibilities
of this tree have never received the attention they deserve. The opinion
is current that the fruit does not ripen and is not edible until it is
subjected to a frost. This is an error. The best and largest fruit I
have ever eaten ripened without a frost. A large native tree on the
Forest Reserve in Clark County ripens its fruit in August, which is of
an excellent quality and usually has only one, and rarely more than
three seeds. The fruit of this tree is of the oblong type. The fruit
varies much in size, time of ripening and quality. Some is scarcely
edible. Some of the native trees bear fruit when they are not over
eight feet tall, some are usually prolific bearers while others bear
sparingly. For this reason if one wishes to grow persimmon trees it
is best to buy grafted trees from some reliable nurseryman. The tree
is hardy throughout Indiana and while it is a very slow growing tree,
it can nevertheless be recommended for ornamental and roadside tree
planting. It is to be noted that cattle will not browse persimmon,
and that hogs greedily eat the ripe fruit. The fruit of many trees does
not fall until early winter, and such trees are a granary for several
kind of animals of the forest.</p>

<p>The wood is hard, heavy, strong and close-grained. Practically the
whole output of persimmon lumber is used in making shuttles. In
Indiana the tree is too rare to furnish much lumber.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Nova Scotia to Minnesota and south to the Gulf.
Frequent to common in all parts of Indiana. It is the most abundant in
the northern two-thirds of the State, where it is associated principally
with beech, sugar maple, linn, slippery elm and red oak. In the
hilly part of the State it is found principally near water courses and in
ravines, and rarely on the white and black oak ridges. It is rarely
found in the low "flats" of the southeast part of the State, or in the
shingle oak bottoms along the Patoka River.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;The foliage of the white ash is quite variable in the

<p>A form of white ash with reddish-purple fruit is found from Steuben
to Clark County. This form is the prevailing type of white ash in
Wayne County in the vicinity of Centerville. It has been described by
Fernald as forma <b>iodocarpa</b>.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The wood is heavy, hard, strong, elastic, sap wood white and the
heart wood light brown. It is one of the most valuable of Indiana woods,
and is used by almost all wood using industries. Its principal uses include
handles, butter tubs, car and vehicle stock, automobiles and
implements.</p>

<p>The white ash has been under cultivation at the Clark County State
Forest for fifteen years, and the present indications are that it is one
of the very best species to use for forest planting. It is hardy; grows
in nearly all kinds of soil, although it prefers a moist, rich soil; transplants
successfully; grows rapidly; bears pruning well; erect in habit
of growth, and so far in our area forest plantings have not been destroyed
by injurious insects. However, in some parts of the State,
where trees have grown in the cities, some have been killed by scale
insects. Aside from this the white ash would be an excellent tree for
roadside planting, because it comes into leaf late, and never produces a
dense shade.</p>

<p>At present seed collectors are not able to separate the species of
ash, and as a consequence white ash seedlings bought from a nursery
are not always true to name. For this reason it is suggested that to
obtain seedlings true to name that seed be collected and planted from
a tree true to name. The seed should be planted in a sandy soil in
rows, about 25 seeds to the foot, and covered about an inch deep with
earth. The trees should be planted 4×4 ft. to 8×8 ft. apart.</p>

Large forest trees, resembling the white ash. Young trees acquire the furrowed
bark character earlier than the white ash, furrows of the bark of mature
trees are usually deeper, and the ridges correspondingly farther apart;
twigs are robust like the white ash and always velvety pubescent except
in age when they may become smooth; leaves generally 2-3.5 dm. long,
rachis pubescent; leaflets 5-11, usually 7-9, generally 5-14 cm. long,
on stalks generally 0.3-1 cm. long, the terminal one on a stalk 2-4
times as long, leaflets broadly ovate to narrow ovate, or oblong to
narrow oblong, narrowed, rounded, or oblique at the base, short or
long acuminate at apex, sometimes merely acute, margins generally
entire, sometimes with a few short teeth toward the apex, dark green
and smooth above, glaucous and more or less pubescent beneath;
fruit similar to the preceding species.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;This species has only recently been separated from
the white ash and its range has not been ascertained. It is known to
occur in the Appalachian Mountains from Pennsylvania to Georgia. In
Indiana it is known to occur as far north as Wells County. It is
commonly associated with the white ash, but much less frequent except
in a few districts where it is the prevailing type. Such a district is in
Gibson County north of Owensville. Here as well as in other parts
of Gibson County very large trees have been observed. In the original
forest the pioneers called the very large specimens of ash with deeply
furrowed bark "the old fashion" ash. It is believed that most of these
specimens were of this species. In the hilly parts of Indiana this
species is found in situations too dry for the white ash, and for this
reason should be given preference in hillside planting.</p>

<p>On the wooded bluff of White River in Fairview Park north of
Indianapolis is a specimen that measures 31 dm. in circumference, b.h.
The deepest furrows on the north side of the tree are 6 cm. deep.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This species is not yet commonly separated from the
white ash and is known to the trade as white ash. Mr. Beadle who first
recognized the species, named it Biltmore ash in honor of the Biltmore
Estate on which the first tree was discovered. Authors ever since have
so called it, and the common name which this form should bear is
Biltmore ash.</p>

<p>On the Clark County State Forest is a planting of sixteen year old
white ash in which are mixed quite a number of Biltmore ash. This
species at a distance, can be distinguished from the white ash by the
rougher bark of the trunks and the darker green color of its foliage, and
in the autumn by its more colored foliage. A closer view shows that the
leaflets of the Biltmore ash stand in a plane above the rachis higher
than those of the white ash.</p>

<p>The wood is not commercially distinguished from the white ash, but
its mechanical properties rank it somewhat below that
species.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Lake Champlain to the Saskatchewan and south to
the Gulf. Found in all parts of Indiana. It is usually found in low
ground along streams, in swamps, and in low woods. It is usually
associated with white elm, red maple, cottonwood, aspens, linn, bur
oak, etc., in the south to this list should be added silver maple and
cypress. It prefers a habitat wetter than that of the white ash, although
the two are found together in wet woods. In swampy woods it is often
a common tree. While it has a general distribution in the State, it is
much more local than the white ash.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This form is not usually separated from the next species,
and both are known in books and by nurserymen as green or red ash.
The common name, green ash, should be applied to this species to
separate it from the true white ash, and the next.</p>

<p>In ash forest plantings on the Clark County State Forest, it is to
be noted that this and the next species bear fruit while the trees are
as small as 1.5 cm. in diameter, while the white and Biltmore ash which
are much older and 6-8 cm. in diameter have never borne fruit. This
species and the next bear fruit oftener and in greater abundance than
the white or Biltmore ash. It is also to be noted that practically all
of the volunteer ash trees found along fences and roadsides, except
very large trees, are of the green ash species.</p>

<p>The wood is similar to that of white ash, and the cut is usually sold
as that species. However, it ranks below white ash in its mechanical
qualities.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>While the native green ash is found growing in swamps, it adapts
itself to drier situations. It is planted more than any other species
of ash in the cold and dry regions of the West and Northwest.</p>

a common to an infrequent tree of the river sloughs and cypress swamps
of the southwestern counties. Authentic specimens are at hand from
Knox, Gibson, Posey, Perry, Bartholomew, Jackson, Marion and
Daviess Counties, and specimens from Hamilton, Tipton and Starke
Counties, I doubtfully refer to this species. The preferred habitat of
this species is inundated swamps, and when it grows in such situations
it generally develops a base swollen to a point somewhat above the
water level. In Bartholomew County it was found associated with
the cow oak, and the trunk resembled the white ash.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This species is known by authors and commercially as
pumpkin ash. The wood is similar to white ash but is inferior to that
species. On account of its habitat this species was little cut until the
past few years when ash became scarce. During the past few years
most of the deep river and cypress swamps have been invaded and all
of the ash cut.</p>

about 0.5 mm. long, and persisting more or less in fruit; fruit ripens
last of June to August, samaras twisted, generally 3-4 cm. long and
8-10 mm. wide, rounded at the base, notched or rounded and apiculate
at the apex, the apical end of all specimens at hand twisted to the

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Southern Ontario to Iowa, and south to northern
Alabama and Arkansas. Found sparingly in most parts of Indiana,
except the northwest part. There are no records northwest of White
and Noble Counties. In the northern two-thirds of the State it is a
rare to very rare tree, generally found only along the bluffs of streams.
In many areas it is so rare that even the pioneers do not know the tree.
It was the most frequent in the southeastern part of the State.
Here also it is found principally along the higher banks of streams.
While the species is confined principally to high ground it also grew in
lower ground. The largest tree seen is on level ground at a fork of the
road between Charlestown and Jeffersonville about 3 miles northeast
of Jeffersonville. In 1918 this tree measured 28.2 dm. (104<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches)
in circumference breast high.</p>

<p>This species has not been observed in the "knob" area of the State
or anywhere in the flats of the Lower Wabash Valley. Schneck
reports it as rare on the hills of this area. The tree is too rare to
definitely determine its associates, although sugar maple is usually
found with it.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;This species is becoming too scarce to be of much
economic importance. The cut is usually sold as white ash. The uses
of the wood are practically the same as the white ash.</p>

<p>The fruit and foliage of this species most closely resembles that
of the black ash, from which it can be distinguished by its greenish-yellow
foliage and the habitat in which it grows.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Nova Scotia to Manitoba, south to Virginia and
northern Arkansas. Local in all parts of Indiana except in the "knob"
area of the State. It is generally found in places that are inundated
much of the winter season. Its habitat is in cold swampy woods or
similar places about lakes. It has no special affinity for streams. It
is local in its distribution. Where it is found it is generally a frequent
to common tree. In the lake area of Indiana its habitat conditions are
frequent, consequently colonies of it are frequent. South of the lake
area of the State it becomes rare to extremely local. In the southwest
part of the State it has been sparingly found in a few cypress swamps.
It is usually associated with white elm, cottonwood, aspens, red maple,
bur oak, and is one of the first species to invade extinct tamarack
swamps.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;The wood is tougher but in most qualities is inferior
to white ash and cannot be used for handles. The layers of growth
separate easily which enables the wood to be separated into thin
strips. This fact was known to the Indians who used this wood for
making baskets. This use was continued by the white man and in
addition it was a favorite wood for making hoops, and in many sections
it is known as the "hoop ash." The wood has many uses such as for
baskets, splint boxes, butter tubs, vehicle stock, interior finish, furniture,
etc. The black burls of the trunk are much sought for by veneer
manufacturers.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Southwestern Indiana and southern Illinois south to
northern Florida and Texas. In Indiana it has been found only in
Knox, Gibson, Posey and Perry Counties. It grows on the low borders
of river sloughs, swamps and river banks. It is very tolerant of shade
and may be found growing under larger trees. It usually forms dense
thickets on the bank that surrounds standing water and is usually
associated with button-bush. A straight specimen is rarely seen because
the area where it grows overflows each winter, and the small trees
are usually covered more or less with debris, and then the following
season the side branches assume a vertical growth. The top may be released
by the next inundation, and then other branches may assume
leadership, and so on until the top is a mass of branches growing in
several directions. The specimens found in Perry County grew on the
low bank of the Ohio River about 6 miles east of Cannelton. The
species is quite local in the area where it is found. It may border one
river slough, and be entirely absent from another nearby.</p>

<p><b>Distribution.</b>&mdash;Known to have been a native of the southwestern
part of Indiana, and to have followed the valley of the Ohio and Mississippi
Rivers to the southeastern part of Missouri and the northeastern
part of Arkansas. The tree has practically disappeared from the forests
of Indiana, and the exact range in Indiana can never be known. Being
such a conspicuous tree, it was thought that the memory of living
pioneers might be relied upon to fix the limits of its range in Indiana.
One pioneer living near Austin in Scott County said it was a native of
the Muscatatuck bottoms, and another said it was a native in the flats of
the southwestern part of Clark County. In its native habitat it was
found only in very low ground, usually with such associates as pin oak,
sweet gum, southern hackberry, big shellbark hickory, pecan, etc. In
its native habitat it was an infrequent to a frequent tree, never a common
tree. A pioneer was interviewed who settled in the Knox County bottoms
about three miles west of Decker, when the whole area was a virgin
forest. He said the catalpa was an occasional tree in the bottoms
throughout the area; that he did not recall that it was ever found in as
low situations as the cypress; that the tree was as tall as its associates,
straight, and usually about 6 dm. in diameter, and that he never saw a
tree a meter in diameter; that on account of the durable quality of
the wood that it was cut for fence posts and rails. A pioneer who
lived near the mouth of Deer Creek in Perry County said it was a native
in his vicinity. The information at hand would fix the mass distribution
of the species to the southwest of a line drawn from Terre Haute to a
point about 6 miles east of Grandview in Spencer County.</p>

<p><b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Attention was directed to this tree about 1880 by Dr.
John A. Warder and Dr. Geo. Engelmann, and it has had enthusiastic
admirers ever since. In Indiana its most enthusiastic advocate was
John P. Brown of Connersville. Its popularity was based upon the
durability of its wood and its rapid growth. Nurserymen grew seedlings
and through their agents plantations of all sizes were sold in many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
States. The trees were planted to grow posts, telephone poles and
crossties. In Indiana there is one plantation 42 years old, but the
majority are only 10 to 15 years old. The tree has been planted long
enough in our area to definitely conclude that it should not be planted
in any part of Indiana for economic purposes. The range of the catalpa
sphinx which defoliates the tree is rapidly increasing, and now ranges as
far north as Wells County. In the southern part of the State the trees
are usually defoliated twice each year by the larvæ of this insect, and as
a consequence the trees make very little growth, and some owners of
plantations have abandoned them on this account. A new insect is
appearing which kills the young shoots, which will interfere with the
upright habit of the tree. The catalpa is not recommended for forest
planting in Indiana, and its use for this purpose has practically ceased.</p>

<p>The catalpa prefers a moist, deep, rich soil, but will grow in almost
all kinds of situations. In the northern part of the State, the young
trees are frequently winter killed. The tree is quite tenacious of life
and when cut off at the ground, usually sends up several coppice shoots.</p>

<p>This species can be recommended for planting for shade for hog lots,
and as a specimen tree in parks, etc. It is not a desirable street tree.</p>

<i>Juniperus communis</i>. In the older floras it was a custom to include
cultivated forms, and not distinguish them as such. Since juniper has
been for years a common ornamental shrub, especially in cemeteries,
it is highly probable that many records have such a basis. It is proposed
to drop this species from our flora. I refer Higley and Raddin's<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> record

be the decumbent form. Heimlich's record I regard as an error, see
remarks under <i>Abies balsamea</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Populus_balsamifera" id="Populus_balsamifera"></a><b>Populus balsamífera</b> Linnæus. <span class="smcap">Balsam Poplar</span>. This species
was reported by Bradner for Steuben County. In a letter from the
late Prof. Bradner, he said he had no specimen and had no recollection
of the tree. J. M. Coulter reported it for Jefferson County, but Young
who also wrote a flora of Jefferson County does not mention it. Baird
and Taylor also reported it for Clark County. The last two records may
have been from cultivated trees or mistaken for <i>Populus grandidentata</i>
which was not reported and is in the area, and is a frequent tree in the
"knobs" in Clark County. Heimlich reports it in Proc. Ind. Acad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Sci. 1917:404:1918 for Cowles. I regard this as an error. See discussion
under <i>Abies canadensis</i> on page 290. Since the range of the species
is to the north of Indiana, it is here proposed to drop it from our flora.
It should be looked for on the "divide" in Steuben County and about
Lake Michigan.</p>

<p><a name="Populus_candicans" id="Populus_candicans"></a><b>Populus cándicans</b> Aiton. <span class="smcap">Balm of Gilead</span>. This species has
been included in a few local floras, but it is believed that it has not yet
escaped from cultivation. Phinney<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> gives it as "an important timber
tree of Delaware County," which is an error.</p>

<p><a name="Populus_nigra" id="Populus_nigra"></a><b>Populus nìgra</b> var. <b>itálica</b> Du Roi. <span class="smcap">Lombardy Poplar</span>. Reference
is made to this tree by Blatchley<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>, Meyncke<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and Nieuwland<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> but
it is scarcely more than an accidental escape.</p>

<p><a name="Carya_aquatica" id="Carya_aquatica"></a><b>Carya aquática</b> Nuttall. <span class="smcap">Water Hickory</span>. This species is listed
as one of the principal trees occurring along the Wabash in the Coblenz
edition of Prince Maximilan's travels in North America. It is recorded
as "Water Bitternut (<i>Juglans aquatica</i>)." If it occurs in our area it
most likely would be found in the extreme southwestern counties.
It has been reported from Gallatin County, Illinois, bordering Posey
County on the west. There are two other records of its occurrence in the
State, which are doubtful. Ryland T. Brown<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> reported it in a list of
the principal trees of Fountain County in a report of the geology of
Fountain County. <i>Carya laciniosa</i>, which is sometimes called
swamp hickory and which is more or less frequent in the county, he
failed to report. It is believed this reference to <i>Carya aquatica</i> should be
referred to <i>laciniosa</i>. B. C. Hobbs also reported it as common in Parke
County in a short list of the principal trees. He named only four of the
five or more species of hickory that occur in the county, and it is believed
since he was no botanist, that he confused the names. Elliott in his
Trees of Indiana gives "<i>Carya aquatica</i>" as common, but no doubt this
reference should be transferred to some other species.</p>

<p><a name="Carya_myristicaeformis" id="Carya_myristicaeformis"></a><b>Carya myristicæfórmis</b> Nuttall. <span class="smcap">Nutmeg Hickory</span>. This tree
also was reported by Prince Maximilian as occurring along the Wabash
River. The known range of the species is from North Carolina to
Arkansas, and for this reason the species is not included in this list.</p>

<p><a name="Betula_lenta" id="Betula_lenta"></a><b>Betula lénta</b> Linnæus. <span class="smcap">Black Birch</span>. This species has been reported
for Indiana as occurring in Fulton, Gibson, Miami, Noble,
Posey, St. Joseph and Steuben Counties. Sargent<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> says: "This species
has until recently been badly misunderstood. The range of the species
is southern Maine to northwestern Vermont, eastern Kentucky, and
south to Delaware and along the Appalachian Mountains to northern
Georgia and Alabama." No doubt all of the Indiana records should be
transferred to <i>Betula lutea</i>, except the Gibson and Posey County record
which may be <i>Betula nigra</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Castanea_pumila" id="Castanea_pumila"></a><b>Castanea púmila</b> (Linnæus) Miller. <span class="smcap">Chinquapin.</span> This species
was given a place in our flora in Coulter's catalogue upon the authority
of Sargent, Ridgway and Schneck. Ridgway, in giving an additional
list of the trees of the Lower Wabash Valley<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> says: "There is some
doubt as to No. 16 <i>Castanea pumila</i>, which is given on Prof. Sargent's
authority; but there is a possibility of an error having been made from
the circumstances that the name 'chinquapin' is in that region almost
universally applied to the fruit of <i>Quercus Muhlenbergii</i>." The Posey
County record was based on a specimen in Dr. Schneck's herbarium,
which proves to have been taken from a cultivated tree near Poseyville.</p>

<p><a name="Quercus_ilicifolia" id="Quercus_ilicifolia"></a><b>Quercus ilicifòlia</b> Wangenheim. <span class="smcap">Bear Oak</span>. This species
is credited to our flora by Will Scott in his ecological study of "The
Leesburg Swamp" in Kosciusko County, published in the Indiana
Academy of Science, 1905, page 225. In a reply to an inquiry addressed
to him he says no herbarium material was preserved. This ecological
work was done during the summer months while working at the
biological station at Winona Lake. In a footnote in this paper we are
informed that for the identification of the trees listed, Apgar's Trees
of the Northern United States was used. In this key to the trees,
<i>Quercus velutina</i> (Black Oak) is given only as a variety of <i>Quercus
coccinea</i> (Scarlet Oak), and the distinction between <i>Quercus velutina</i>
with its many formed leaves, and <i>Quercus ilicifolia</i> is not made apparent.
In view of the fact that the natural habitat of <i>Quercus ilicifolia</i> is
sandy barrens and rocky hillsides and its western range is eastern Ohio,
it is believed what Mr. Scott had in hand was a variable form of <i>Quercus
velutina</i>, which is frequent in that vicinity. The evidence is not
encouraging enough to include it.</p>

<p><a name="Quercus_nigra" id="Quercus_nigra"></a><b>Quercus nìgra</b> Linnæus. <span class="smcap">Water Oak</span>. This species has been
reported by several authors for Indiana. It is believed that a majority
of the records should be transferred to <i>velutina</i> and <i>imbricaria</i> or
<i>marylandica</i>. Gorby and Schneck call <i>Quercus nigra</i> black jack oak,
which is generally the common name for <i>Quercus marilandica</i>. Ridgway
in his writings of the flora of the lower Wabash Valley, likewise speaks
of <i>Quercus nigra</i> as jack oak and says it is found in poor soil. Coulter
in his catalogue of Indiana plants regarded these references to <i>nigra</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
as errors and did not include it in his list. The report for Crawford
County by Deam should be transferred to <i>marilandica</i>. Since the
range of the species is not north of Kentucky, the reference to the
species in the State should be dropped.</p>

<p>The published records are as follows: Carroll (Thompson); Crawford
(Deam); Delaware, Jay, Randolph and Wayne (Phinney); Jay (McCaslin);
Fountain (Brown); Miami (Gorby); Parke (Hobbs).</p>

<p><a name="Quercus_Phellos" id="Quercus_Phellos"></a><b>Quercus Phéllos</b> Linnæus. <span class="smcap">Willow Oak</span>. This species has been
reported from various counties of the State. The tree is said to grow
in swamps and on sandy uplands, ranging from Staten Island, New
York, south to Florida and west to Texas, and north to southern
Kentucky. If it occurs within our area it no doubt would have been
found by Dr. Schneck, who was an enthusiastic student of the oaks.
He reported it as occurring in the lower Wabash in his early writings,
but his herbarium contained no specimens. The writer while in search
for this species in Posey County met three men in widely separated
parts of the county who were acquainted with the species in the South
and they said they had never seen it in Indiana. One of the men was an
old man who had spent his boyhood in Arkansas and he was well acquainted
with the willow oak before he came to Indiana. It is believed
what has been reported for <i>Q. Phellos</i> has been narrow-leaved forms of
<i>Q. imbricaria</i> (shingle oak), and that the records should be transferred to
that species.</p>

<p>The published records are as follows: Gibson, Knox and Posey
(Schneck); Knox (Thomas); Miami (Gorby).</p>

<p><a name="Quercus_prinoides" id="Quercus_prinoides"></a><b>Quercus prinoìdes</b> Willdenow. <span class="smcap">Scrub or Dwarf Chestnut Oak</span>.
Reported for Marshall County by Nieuwland<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> on the authority of a
specimen deposited in the National Museum collected by Clark. I had
this reference checked by E. S. Steele and in a letter to me dated January
4, 1917, he says: "I find no specimen labeled <i>Quercus prinoides</i>, but there
is one named <i>Q. Prinus</i>. There is no ground for calling it <i>Q. prinoides</i>."
Since the specimen in question is a very immature one, I propose not to
take it into consideration since the range of the species would be
extended on a dubious specimen.</p>

<p><a name="Planera_aquatica" id="Planera_aquatica"></a><b>Planèra aquática</b> (Walter) J. F. Gmelin. <span class="smcap">Planer-tree</span>. <span class="smcap">Water
Elm</span>. This tree was included in Coulter's catalogue upon the authority
of Sargent, who includes Indiana in the range of the species in his
"Forest Trees of North America," Vol. 9, U.S. Census Report, 1880,
page 124. Dr. Schneck spent a lifetime along the lower Wabash bottoms
and very carefully preserved specimens of all the flora of the region
where this species is reported to occur. In his report of the flora of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
region in 1875 he does not include this tree. An examination of his
herbarium material showed no specimens of this tree either from Indiana
or Illinois. It is fair to presume if he had been acquainted with the
tree he would have had it represented in his herbarium. Since the white
elm is frequently called water elm, as well as the planer-tree, it is
easy to understand how confusion might arise in separating these trees
by non-professional people.</p>

<p><a name="Morus_nigra" id="Morus_nigra"></a><b>Morus nìgra</b> Linnæus. <span class="smcap">Black Mulberry</span>. This species is reported
by Phinney<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> as one of the "more important and common forest trees
observed in Delaware County." He also enumerates <i>Morus rubra</i>. A
splendid example of careless work. This species is reported by Brown<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
for Fountain County, and by McCaslin<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> for Jay County. These authors
reported this species as a native forest tree. Since this species is
not a native of the United States the citations no doubt should be referred
to our native mulberry, <i>Morus rubra</i> (red mulberry).</p>

<p><a name="Ilex_opaca" id="Ilex_opaca"></a><b>Ìlex opàca</b> Aiton. <span class="smcap">Holly.</span> This species was included in Coulter's
Catalogue of the Plants of Indiana on the authority of Robert Ridgway.
I find no reference to this species in the writings of Ridgway.</p>

<p>In Shawnee Park on the west side of Louisville, Kentucky is a large
tree of this species. I was told that it was a native. A timber buyer of
Tell City told me that there was a native tree on his grandfather's farm
in the southern part of Perry County. Since this species has been reported
for Grayson County, Kentucky, which is less than forty miles
to the south, it is quite probable that a few trees were found as far north
as Indiana.</p>

<p><a name="Acer_pennsylvanicum" id="Acer_pennsylvanicum"></a><b>Acer pennsylvánicum</b> Linnæus. <span class="smcap">Moosewood.</span> The only record
of this species occurring in Indiana is in a report of the Trees occurring
along the Wabash River by Prince Maximilian. Since the report does
not definitely state where the species was observed or how frequently
it occurred and since the greater part of Maximilian's time was spent
on the Illinois side of the Wabash, it is more than likely that he observed
it on the Illinois side of the Wabash. While Indiana is within the
possible range of the species, it has not been discovered since. If not
extinct in our area it is most likely to be found among the hills of the
southern counties or in the vicinity of Lake Michigan. Robert Ridgway
says that he and Dr. Schneck saw it growing in a wooded cove
near a cavern called Flory's Cave in Johnson County, Illinois.</p>

<p><a name="Nyssa_aquatica" id="Nyssa_aquatica"></a><b>Nyssa aquática</b> Linnæus. <span class="smcap">Tupelo Gum</span>. Several early authors
erroneously reported <i>Nyssa sylvatica</i> as this species. This species inhabits
deep swamps. Dr. Schneck and Robert Ridgway, recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
authorities and best acquainted with the swamp area of the southwestern
counties, at first thought it was a member of our flora, but later
decided that it should be excluded.</p>

<p>Michael Catt, 83 years old, who lived nearly 75 years about three
miles west of Decker on the border of the cypress swamp in the south
part of Knox County, told me that he is positive that the tupelo gum
was an occasional tree in the cypress swamp west of Decker.</p>

<p><a name="Fraxinus_caroliniana" id="Fraxinus_caroliniana"></a><b>Fraxinus caroliniàna</b> Miller. <span class="smcap">Water Ash</span>. This species was
included in Coulter's Catalogue of Indiana Plants upon the authority
of Dr. Schneck. It is asserted that specimens were sent to Missouri
Botanical Gardens for verification. The writer has carefully examined
all the specimens of <i>Fraxinus</i> in the Missouri Botanical Gardens, and
all of Schneck's specimens in the herbarium are now correctly named
<i>Fraxinus profunda</i>. Since this species is not in our range it should be
dropped from our flora.</p>

sometimes lobed, blades 6-13 cm. long, cordate at the base, acute at apex, at maturity glabrous
above and glabrous beneath or with some hairs on the veins and in the axils of the veins;
fruit subglobose or oblong, 1-2 cm. long, white to pinkish. This is an introduced tree and
has been reported as an escape in many parts of the State, especially by the older botanists.
<b>Morus alba</b> variety <b>tatarica</b> Loudon, the Russian mulberry, has been reported as an escape.
The writer has seen single specimens as an escape in woods in Cass and Marshall Counties.
It can be distinguished by practically all of the leaves being more or less lobed and the reddish
fruit. This form was introduced into the United States in great numbers about fifty years
ago by the Mennonites. It was especially recommended by nurserymen for fence posts and
it has been planted to some extent in Indiana, but it cannot be recommended. It grows too
slowly and is too crooked to compensate for any lasting qualities the wood may have. <b>Morus
nigra</b> has been reported from Indiana by Phinney, Brown and McCaslin as a forest tree. Since
this is an introduced tree, and is not supposed to be hardy in our area, their reports should be
transferred to some other species.</p></div>
